# Security Enablement

Edge AI is revolutionising traffic management and road safety, but it also introduces critical cybersecurity challenges. With AI systems handling sensitive city data and making autonomous decisions, robust security is essential. Intel platforms provide built-in security features to protect data, infrastructure, and AI processing.

This tutorial provides steps and guidance to enable built-in Intel security features with the **Smart Intersection** application to ensure:
- **Comprehensive Data Privacy**: Protect sensitive personal data with strong encryption protocols and blockchain technology, ensuring secure transactions and compliance with regulations.
- **Infrastructure Protection**: Safeguard your critical infrastructure with regular firmware updates and advanced threat detection systems, mitigating vulnerabilities in distributed edge devices.
- **Secure AI Processing**: Leverage privacy-by-design principles and hardware-level security features to prevent AI model manipulation and ensure secure, compliant AI operations.

This guide covers security enablement for the Smart Intersection application, including:
- [Discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM)](./security-features/enable_dtpm.md).
- [UEFI Secure Boot](./security-features/enable_uefi.md).
- [Full Disk Encryption (FDE)](./security-features/enable_full_disk_install.md).
- [Total Memory Encryption(TME)](./security-features/enable_tme.md).
- [Trusted Compute deployment for isolated video analytics](./security-features/enable_trusted_compute.md).

These security features protect the Smart Intersection system from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity for traffic monitoring and analysis.

By leveraging Intel's cutting-edge security solutions, transportation systems can fully harness the potential of Edge AI and Agentic AI while safeguarding against potential threats. This paves the way for smarter, safer cities, where AI-driven threat detection and digital twins for cybersecurity scenarios continue to evolve. Trust Intel to provide the security technologies needed to meet the demands of modern urban environments, with affordable and secure AI and protect your transportation infrastructure.

## Benefits

With these security features enabled, your **Smart Intersection** application will benefit from:
