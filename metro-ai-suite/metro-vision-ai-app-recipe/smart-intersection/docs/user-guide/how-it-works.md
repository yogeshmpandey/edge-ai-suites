# How It Works

This section provides a high-level view of how the application integrates with a typical system architecture.

![High-Level System Diagram](./_assets/smart-intersection-architecture.drawio.svg)

## Diagram Description

- **Inputs**:
  - **Video Files** - Four traffic intersection cameras that capture videos simultaneously.
  - **Scene Database** - Pre-configured intersection scene with satellite view of intersection, calibrated cameras, and regions of interest.
  Video recordings are used to simulate a live feed from cameras deployed at a traffic intersection. The application can be configured to work with live cameras.
- **Processing**:
  - **Video Analytics** - Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server (DL Streamer Pipeline Server) utilizes a pre-trained object detection model to generate object detection metadata and and a local NTP server for synchronized timestamps. This metadata is published to the MQTT broker.
  - **Sensor Fusion** - Scene Controller Microservice fuses the metadata from video analytics utilizing scene data obtained through the Scene Management API. It uses the fused tracks and the configured analytics (regions of interest) to generate events that are published to the MQTT broker.
  - **Aggregate Scene Analytics** - Region of interests analytics are read from the MQTT broker and stored in an InfluxDB bucket that enables time series analysis through Flux queries.
- **Outputs**:
  - Fused object tracks are available on the MQTT broker and visualized through the Scene Management UI.
  - Aggregate scene analytics are visualized through a Grafana dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Feature 1**: Architecture based on modular microservices enables composability and reconfiguration.
- **Feature 2**: Optimized video pipelines for Intel edge devices.
- **Feature 3**: Scene-based analytics allow insights beyond single sensor views.
