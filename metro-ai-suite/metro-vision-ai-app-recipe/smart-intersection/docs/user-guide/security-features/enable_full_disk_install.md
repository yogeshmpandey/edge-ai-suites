# Ubuntu Installation with Full Disk Encryption

Full Disk Encryption (FDE) protects Smart Intersection application data and configurations by
encrypting the entire disk. This ensures that sensitive traffic analysis data and system
configurations remain secure even if the hardware is compromised.

Once FDE is enabled, the encrypted disk can only be accessed with the security key configured
during installation.

## Ubuntu Installation with FDE Walkthrough

### Step 1: Prepare Ubuntu Installation Media

1. Download the official Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS release from the Ubuntu website
2. Create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive
3. Enter the boot manager menu and select the bootable USB with Ubuntu 24.04.2

### Step 2: Begin Ubuntu Installation

Boot from the bootable USB and select "Try or Install Ubuntu".

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

Configure language, accessibility options, keyboard layout, and other basic settings.
Optionally, connect to wired internet if available.

### Step 4: Select Installation Type

Select "Install Ubuntu" option.

### Step 5: Choose Installation Mode

Select "Interactive Installation" for full control over security settings.

### Step 6: Configure Applications

In the Applications page, select "Default selection". If you made a wired connection earlier,
select both checkboxes.

### Step 7: Enable Disk Encryption

In the Disk setup page:
1. Select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
2. Click the "Advanced features" button to access encryption options

### Step 8: Choose Encryption Method

There are two FDE methods available. Choose based on your Smart Intersection security requirements:

#### Method 1: Software-based Encryption
- Select **"Use LVM and encryption"**
- This encrypts your entire drive using LVM
- Requires a strong passphrase that you will enter at boot time to decrypt and access your system

#### Method 2: Hardware-backed Full Disk Encryption
- Uses dedicated security chips (TPM or Secure Enclave) to store encryption keys
- Provides stronger protection than software-only encryption

> **Note:** To enable this option, you must first enable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI settings
> and clear/reset the TPM module

If Hardware-backed full disk encryption is enabled, you can skip Steps 9 and 12 as the TPM
chip will automatically handle key management and drive decryption.

**TPM Recovery Key**: Use the following command to show TPM recovery keys:
```bash
sudo snap recovery --show-keys
```

### Step 9: Create Security Key (Software-based Encryption Only)

Create a **Security Key** that will be required to decrypt the Ubuntu drive before accessing the Smart Intersection application.

### Step 10: Complete Installation Configuration

Complete the installation by configuring:
- Username and password
- Timezone settings
- Review your choices before proceeding

### Step 11: Finalize Installation

1. Complete the installation process
2. Restart the PC when prompted
3. Remove the bootable drive when instructed after restart

### Step 12: First Boot with Encryption (Software-based Encryption Only)

1. Enter your **Security Key** from Step 9 as the encryption password to unlock the disk
2. The Ubuntu login screen will appear
3. Ubuntu installation with FDE is now completed and ready for Smart Intersection deployment
