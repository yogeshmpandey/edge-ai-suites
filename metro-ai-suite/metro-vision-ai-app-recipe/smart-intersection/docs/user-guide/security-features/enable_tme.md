# Enable Total Memory Encryption (TME)

Intel TME encrypts the computer's entire memory with a single transient key. All memory data
passing to and from the CPU is encrypted, including sensitive Smart Intersection data such as
traffic analysis algorithms, detection models, credentials, encryption keys, and other
proprietary information.

## Enable TME Walkthrough

### Step 1: Check TME Support

First, verify if TME is supported on the Intel platform. Read bits 35:32 of MSR 0x981. If this value is non-zero, TME is supported.

### Step 2: Enable TME in BIOS

1. Enter BIOS menu by pressing 'F2' while booting the platform
2. Navigate to: **Intel Advanced Menu → CPU Configuration → Total Memory Encryption**
3. Set to **Enabled**
4. Save changes (F4) and reboot

### Step 3: Verify TME Enablement

Check if TME is enabled by reading bit 1 of MSR 0x982. If TME is enabled, the value returned will be 1 as shown.

### Step 4: Alternative Verification Using Kernel Logs

You can also use the `dmesg` kernel log to check TME enablement status:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i tme
```
