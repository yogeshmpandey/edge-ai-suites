# How to Deploy with the Edge Orchestrator

Edge Orchestrator, part of Intel’s Edge Software, simplifies edge application deployment and
management, making it easier to deploy edge solutions at scale. Edge Orchestrator provides:

* **Secure Infrastructure Management**: Offers secure and efficient remote onboarding and
management of your edge node fleet across sites and geographies. Zero-trust security
configuration reduces the time required to secure your edge applications.

* **Deployment Orchestration and Automation**: Lets you roll out and update applications and
configure infrastructure nodes across your network from a single pane of glass. Edge
Orchestrator provides automated cluster orchestration and dynamic application deployment.

* **Automated Deployment**: Automates the remote installation and updating of applications at
scale.

* **Deep Telemetry**: Gives you policy-based life cycle management and centralized visibility
into your distributed edge infrastructure and deployments.

* **Flexible Configuration**: From organizing your physical infrastructure to managing the
permutations of executing applications in a variety of runtime environments, Edge Orchestrator
gives you the flexibility to define the policies, criteria, and hierarchies that make the most
sense for your specific business needs.

To deploy the **Loitering Detection** Sample Application with the Edge Orchestrator, follow
the steps in this document.

## Deploy with Edge Orchestrator

### Prerequisites

1. Access to the web interface of the Edge Orchestrator with one or more [edge nodes onboarded](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/set_up_edge_infra/edge_node_onboard/index.html) to the Edge Orchestrator.

1. Clusters with a [privilege template](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/advanced_functionality/set_up_a_cluster_template.html) have been created on the needed edge nodes by following the steps in [Create Cluster](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/set_up_edge_infra/clusters/create_clusters.html).

### Make the Deployment Package Available

1. Clone the **Loitering Detection** repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites
    cd metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/loitering-detection
    ```

1. From the web browser, open the URL of the Edge Orchestrator and import the deployment
package in the folder **deployment-package** by following the steps described in
[Import Deployment Package](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/package_software/import_deployment.html#import-deployment-package).

1. After you have imported the deployment package into Edge Orchestrator, you can see it in
the list of deployment packages:

See [Deployment Packages](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/package_software/deploy_packages.html#view-deployment-packages)
for more information on deployment packages.

### Deploy the Application onto the Edge Nodes

To set up a deployment:

1. Click the **Deployments** tab on the top menu to view the Deployments page. On the
Deployments page, you can view the list of deployments that have been created. The status
indicator shows a quick view of the status of the deployment, which depends on many factors.

1. Select the **Deployments** tab and click the **Setup a Deployment** button. The Setup a
Deployment page appears.

1. On the Setup a Deployment page, select the **ld** package for the deployment from the list,
and click **Next**. The Select a Profile step appears.

1. In the Select a Profile step, select the deployment profile, and click **Next**. The
Override Profile Values page appears.

1. The Override Profile Values page shows the deployment profile values that are available
for overriding. Provide the necessary overriding values, then click **Next** to proceed to
the Select Deployment Type step.

1. On the Select Deployment Type page, select the type of deployment, and click **Next**:

    1. If you select **Automatic** as the deployment type, enter the deployment name and
    metadata in the key-value format to select the target cluster.

    1. If you select **Manual** as the deployment type, enter the deployment name and select
    the clusters from the list of clusters.

1. Click **Next** to view the Review page.

1. Verify that the deployment details are correct and click **Deploy**.

After a few minutes, the deployment will start and will take about 5 minutes to complete.

In the Edge Orchestrator Web UI, you can track the application installation through the
[View Deployment Details](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/package_software/deployment_details.html#view-deployment-details) page.

The **Loitering Detection** Sample Application is fully deployed when the applications become
green and the status is shown as _Running_.

You can view the deployment status on the Deployments page.

> **Note:** If the deployment fails for any reason, the deployment status will display the
“Error” or “Down” status.

For more information on setting up a deployment, see [Set up a Deployment](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/package_software/setup_deploy.html#set-up-a-deployment).

### Access the **Loitering Detection** Sample Application

1. Download the kubeconfig file of the edge node cluster that contains the deployed
application. See [Kubeconfig Download](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/edge-manage-docs/dev/user_guide/set_up_edge_infra/clusters/accessing_clusters.html).

1. Follow the steps in the **Loitering Detection** [Documentation](./how-to-deploy-with-helm.md#step-3-deploy-the-application-and-run-multiple-ai-pipelines) on the usage of the application.

   > **Note:** Skip the Deploy Helm chart step.
