# Getting Started Guide - OEP Gen AI SDK

## Overview

The OEP Gen AI SDK provides a comprehensive development environment for generative AI applications using Intel's optimized tools and microservices. This guide demonstrates the installation process and provides a practical question-answering implementation using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this guide, you will be able to:

- Install and configure the OEP Gen AI SDK
- Deploy generative AI microservices for document processing and question-answering
- Understand the architecture of RAG-based applications using Intel's AI frameworks

## System Requirements

Verify that your development environment meets the following specifications:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Memory: Minimum 64GB RAM (recommended for LLM operations)
- Storage: 100GB available disk space for models and data
- Network: Active internet connection for package downloads

## Installation Process

Execute the automated installation script to configure the complete development environment:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/refs/heads/main/metro-ai-suite/metro-sdk-manager/scripts/oep-gen-ai-sdk.sh | bash
```

## Question-Answering Application Implementation

This section demonstrates a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application workflow using the installed Gen AI components.

### Step 1: Configure Environment and Dependencies

Set up the Python virtual environment and install required dependencies:

```bash
cd $HOME/oep/edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer-core
# Configure application environment variables
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
export REGISTRY="intel/"
export UI_TAG=core_2026.2.0-rc1
export BACKEND_TAG=core_2026.2.0-rc1
source scripts/setup_env.sh
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Application

Start the complete Gen AI application stack using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up
```


### Step 3: Access the Application Interface

Open a web browser and navigate to the application dashboard:

```bash
http://localhost:8102
```
