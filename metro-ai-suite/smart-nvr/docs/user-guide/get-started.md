# Smart NVR - Getting Started

## Overview

Smart NVR is a GenAI-powered video analytics application that transforms traditional network video recorders with intelligent event detection and real-time insights at the edge. This guide will walk you through deploying and configuring the application to extract valuable insights from your video data.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- System must meet [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md)
- 3-4 devices for distributed deployment

Smart NVR operates in a distributed architecture requiring multiple services across 3-4 devices for optimal performance:

| Device | Service | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Device 1 | VSS Search | Video search functionality |
| Device 2 | VSS Summary | Video summarization |
| Device 3 | VLM Microservice | AI-powered event descriptions (optional) |
| Device 3/4 | Smart NVR App | Main application interface |

### Software Dependencies
- **Docker**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - Must be configured to run without sudo ([Post-install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/))
- **Git**: [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Required Services

Before setting up Smart NVR, ensure these services are running on their respective devices:

#### 1. VSS (Video Search and Summarization) Services
Deploy these on separate devices:
- **VSS Search**: Handles video search functionality
- **VSS Summary**: Provides video summarization capabilities

📖 [VSS Documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/sample-applications/video-search-and-summarization/docs/user-guide/get-started.md)

#### 2. VLM Microservice (Optional)
Required only when enabling AI-powered event descriptions (`NVR_GENAI=true`):
- Runs the VLM model defined in the frigate [config file](../../resources/frigate-config/config.yml)
- Use `VLM_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` to limit response length during deployment

📖 [VLM Serving Documentation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/blob/main/microservices/vlm-openvino-serving/docs/user-guide/get-started.md)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/smart-nvr
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Set up the required environment variables:

```bash
# Docker Registry Details
export REGISTRY_URL="intel"
export TAG="1.2.0"

# VSS Service Endpoints
export VSS_SUMMARY_IP=<vss-summary-device-ip>
export VSS_SUMMARY_PORT=<vss-summary-port>        # Default: 12345
export VSS_SEARCH_IP=<vss-search-device-ip>
export VSS_SEARCH_PORT=<vss-search-port>          # Default: 12345

# MQTT Configuration
export MQTT_USER=<mqtt-username>
export MQTT_PASSWORD=<mqtt-password>

export NVR_GENAI=false                  
```

### Step 3: Launch Application

```bash
# Start all services
source setup.sh start
```

This launches all required containers:

### Step 4: Access the Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://<host-ip>:7860
```

### Step 5: Stop Services

```bash
# Stop all services when done
source setup.sh stop
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Enabling AI-Powered Event Descriptions

To enable Smart NVR's GenAI capabilities for intelligent event descriptions:

#### 1. Update Frigate Configuration
Modify `resources/frigate-config/config.yml`:

```yaml
genai:
  enabled: true
```

#### 2. Ensure VLM Service Availability
Verify the VLM microservice is running and accessible at the configured endpoint.

#### 3. Set Environment Variable
```bash
export NVR_GENAI=true
export VLM_SERVING_IP=<vlm-serving-device-ip>
export VLM_SERVING_PORT=<vlm-serving-port>  
```

#### 4. Run the application

Re-run the application after [configuring](./get-started.md#step-2-configure-environment) the rest of environment variables. Ensure that the environment value `export NVR_GENAI=true` is set.

> **⚠️ Important Notes**:
> - This feature is experimental and may be unstable due to underlying Frigate GenAI implementation
> - Requires VLM microservice to be running
> - Disabled by default for system stability

### Custom Build Configuration

If using custom [build flags](./how-to-build-from-source.md#customizing-the-build), ensure the same environment variables are set before running the setup script.
