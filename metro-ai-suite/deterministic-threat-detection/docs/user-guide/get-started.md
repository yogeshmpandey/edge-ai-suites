# Get Started

This guide provides a streamlined path to setting up and running the Deterministic Threat
Detection demonstration. It covers the essential prerequisites and the main steps to see the
system in action.

## Hardware Details

- **AXIS RTSP Cameras**: Cameras that support RTSP streaming.
- **MOXA TSN Switch**: A switch that supports IEEE 802.1AS (PTP) and IEEE 802.1Qbv (Time-Aware Shaper).
- **Arrow Lake Machines**: Linux-based systems equipped with Intel i226 TSN-capable network cards.

## Network Topology

![TSN Network Topology](./_assets/TSN-Network-Topology.svg)

The experimental setup consists of:

- **2 × [AXIS RTSP Camera P3265-LVE](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-p3265-lve)**
- **1 × [Moxa Managed Switch TSN-G5000 Series](https://www.moxa.com/getmedia/a0db0ef9-2741-4bad-91c6-1ec1827aca64/moxa-tsn-g5000-series-web-console-manual-v2.3.pdf)**
- **5 × Arrow Lake Linux Machines with `Intel i226` TSN network cards**

### Logical Roles

| Machine | Role |
|---------|------|
| Machine 1 | Camera 1 RTSP Capture + AI Inference |
| Machine 2 | Camera 2 RTSP Capture + AI Inference |
| Machine 3 | Sensor Data Producer (MQTT) |
| Machine 4 | MQTT Aggregator + Visualization |
| Machine 5 | Traffic Injector (`iperf`) |

All machines are connected to a MOXA switch and synchronized using PTP.

## Steps to Test the Use Case

1. **Configure PTP on all machines.**

   Synchronize the system clocks of all machines to a
   common time reference using Precision Time Protocol (PTP). This is essential for accurate
   latency measurement.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y linuxptp git
   git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/linuxptp/code linuxptp
   cd linuxptp
   # Terminal 1: Run ptp4l to synchronize the PTP clock
   sudo ptp4l -i enp1s0 -f configs/gPTP.cfg --step_threshold=1 -m -s
   # Terminal 2: Run phc2sys to synchronize the system clock to the PTP clock
   sudo phc2sys -s enp1s0 -c CLOCK_REALTIME --step_threshold=1 --transportSpecific=1 -w -m
   ```

   > **Note:** Make sure to replace `enp1s0` with the actual network interface name associated
   > with the `i226` network card.

   For detailed instructions on configuring PTP, refer to the [PTP Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/configure-ptp.md).

2. **Create VLAN on all machines.**

   Set up Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segregate network traffic,
   isolating critical data from best-effort traffic.

   > **Note:** Configure the VLAN on the MOXA as mentioned in the
   > [MOXA VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/configure-vlan-on-moxa-switch.md)    to assign VLAN ID on TSN switch.

   On the Arrow Lake machines, create VLAN interfaces corresponding to the VLAN IDs
   configured on the MOXA switch.

   ```bash
   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.1 type vlan id 1
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.1 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:1
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.1 192.168.127.31 up

   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.3 type vlan id 3
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.3 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:3
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.3 192.168.3.31 up

   sudo ip link add link enp1s0 name enp1s0.5 type vlan id 5
   sudo ip link set enp1s0.5 type vlan egress-qos-map 0:5
   sudo ifconfig enp1s0.5 192.168.5.31 up
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > - Make sure to replace `enp1s0` with the actual network interface name associated
   >   with the `i226` network card.

   For detailed instructions on creating VLANs on HOST machines, refer to the
   [HOST VLAN Configuration Guide](./how-to-guides/create-vlan-on-all-machines.md).

3. **Run RTSP Camera Capture and AI Inference.**

   Start the video pipeline on Machines 1 and 2. This involves capturing the RTSP stream,
   timestamping frames using the PTP-synchronized clock, and running AI inference on the
   video and publish the results over MQTT.

   For detailed instructions on running RTSP camera capture and AI inference, refer to the
   [RTSP Camera and AI Inference Guide](./how-to-guides/run-rtsp-camera-and-ai-inference.md).

4. **Run Sensor Data Producer.**

   On Machine 3, start the Python script that simulates a sensor generating and publishing timestamped data over MQTT.

   For detailed instructions on running the sensor data producer, refer to the
   [Sensor Data Producer Guide](./how-to-guides/run-sensor-data-producer.md).

5. **Run MQTT Aggregator and Visualization.**

   On Machine 4, launch the application that subscribes to the MQTT topics, calculates end-to-end latency, and displays it on a live dashboard.

   For detailed instructions on running the MQTT aggregator and visualization, refer to the
   [MQTT Aggregator and Visualization Guide](./how-to-guides/run-mqtt-aggregator-and-visualization.md).

6. **Run Traffic Injector.**

   On Machine 5, use iPerf3 to generate high-volume background
   traffic to simulate network congestion.

   ![MQTT Data Aggregator With Traffic](./_assets/mqtt-data-aggregator-with-traffic.png)

   For detailed instructions on running the traffic injector, refer to the
   [Traffic Injector Guide](./how-to-guides/run-traffic-injector.md).

7. **Enable TSN Traffic Shaping.**

   Configure the Time-Aware Shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv) on the MOXA switch to prioritize the
   critical traffic from cameras and sensors, protecting it from the background traffic.
   ![MOXA Time Aware Shaper](./_assets/moxa-time-aware-shaper-port-setting.png)

   For detailed instructions on enabling TSN traffic shaping, refer to the
   [TSN Traffic Shaping Guide](./how-to-guides/enable-tsn-traffic-shaping.md).

8. **Analyze Results and Visualize Latency.**

   Observe the latency graphs on the MQTT Aggregator dashboard. With TSN enabled,
   the latency for critical traffic should remain low and deterministic, even with
   the iPerf3 traffic running.
