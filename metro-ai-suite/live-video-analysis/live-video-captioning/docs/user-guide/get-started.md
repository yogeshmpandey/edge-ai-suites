# Get Started

The Live Video Captioning sample application demonstrates real-time video captioning using Intel® DLStreamer and OpenVINO™. It processes RTSP video stream, applies video analytics pipelines for efficient decoding and inference, and leverages a Vision-Language Model(VLM) to generate live captions for the video content. In addition to captioning, the application provides performance metrics such as throughput and latency, enabling developers to evaluate and optimize end-to-end system performance for real-time scenarios.

By following this guide, you will learn how to:
- **Set up the sample application**: Use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the application in your environment.
- **Run the application**: Execute the application to see real-time captioning from your video stream.
- **Modify application parameters**: Customize settings like inference models and VLM parameters to adapt the application to your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Verify that your system meets the minimum requirements. See [System Requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md) for details.
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Install Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- RTSP stream source (live camera or test feed). Please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/scenescape/tree/main/tools/streamer) to create simulated RTSP test feed stram using exisiting video files.
- OpenVINO-compatible VLM in `ov_models/`. User may follow the steps outlined in [Model Preparation](#model-preparation) provided to prepare the model.
- OpenVINO-compatible Object Detection Models in `ov_detection_models/`. This is only required
when object detection in the pipeline is enabled. Please refer to the [Object Detection Pipeline configuration](./object-detection-pipeline.md) guide for information on how to enable it.

## Run the application

1. **Clone the repository**:
     ```bash
     # Clone the latest on mainline
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git edge-ai-suites
     # Alternatively, clone a specific release branch
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git edges-ai-suites -b <release-tag>
     ```

> **Note:** Adjust the repo link appropriately in case of forked repo.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
     ```bash
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/live-video-analysis/live-video-captioning
     ```

3. **Configure Image Registry and Tag**:
     ```bash
        export REGISTRY="intel/"
        export TAG="latest"
     ```
    Skip this step if you prefer to build the sample applciation from source. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Build from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md) guide for details.

4. **Configure Environment**:

    Create a `.env` file in the repository root:
     ```bash
     WHIP_SERVER_IP=mediamtx
     WHIP_SERVER_PORT=8889
     WHIP_SERVER_TIMEOUT=30s
     PROJECT_NAME=live-captioning
     HOST_IP=<HOST_IP>
     EVAM_HOST_PORT=8040
     EVAM_PORT=8080
     DASHBOARD_PORT=4173
     WEBRTC_PEER_ID=stream
     WEBRTC_BITRATE=5000
     ALERT_MODE=False
     ENABLE_DETECTION_PIPELINE=False
     CAPTION_HISTORY=3
     ```
    Notes:
    - `HOST_IP` must be reachable by the browser client for WebRTC signaling.
    - `PIPELINE_SERVER_URL` defaults to `http://dlstreamer-pipeline-server:8080`.
    - `WEBRTC_BITRATE` controls the video bitrate in kbps for WebRTC streaming (default: 2048).
    - `CAPTION_HISTORY` controls how many previous captions are shown in the caption timeline. The UI shows current + `CAPTION_HISTORY` previous entries (`0` means only current). This value can be changed from the UI also.

5. **Download/Export Models**:

    Follow the steps outlined in the [Model Preparation](#model-preparation) section.

6. **Start the Application**:

    Start the application using Docker Compose tool:
     ```bash
     docker compose up
     ```

7. **Access the Application**:

    To start processing video with live captioning:

    1. Open the dashboard at `http://<HOST_IP>:4173`.
    2. Enter an RTSP URL for your video stream.
    3. Select a VLM model from the dropdown.
    4. Customize the prompt and maximum tokens as needed.
    5. Click **Start** to begin captioning.

    > **Note:** If running in a proxy network, ensure that your RTSP stream URLs or IPs are added to the `no_proxy` environment variable to allow direct connections to the stream source without going through the proxy.

8. **Stop the Services**:

    Stop the sample application services using below:
     ```bash
     docker compose down
     ```

## Model Preparation

To run this sample application, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) is required. If you wish to enable the detection pipeline, you will also need a YOLO vision model. Model preparation is handled using the [model-download microservice](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/model-download) from the open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries. Follow the steps below to download and convert the required models:

1. **Clone the repository**:

     Open a new terminal, clone the edge-ai-libraries repository.
     ```bash
     # Clone the latest on the mainline
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries
     # Alternatively, clone a specific release branch
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries -b <release-tag>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
     ```bash
     cd edge-ai-libraries/microservices/model-download
     ```

3. **Configure the environment variables**:
     ```bash
     export REGISTRY="intel/"
     export TAG=latest
     export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
     ```

4. **Launch the service with required plugins**:
     ```bash
     export MODEL_PATH=<path-to-live-video-captioning>
     # Example: export MODEL_PATH=~/edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/live-video-analysis/live-video-captioning

     # Run the script to launch the service
     source scripts/run_service.sh --plugins openvino,ultralytics --model-path $MODEL_PATH
     ```

5. **Download/Convert the models**:

     Return to the live-captioning repository terminal you opened earlier.
     ```bash
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/live-video-analysis/live-video-captioning
     ```

     Download and convert the required models using the provided script:
     ```bash
     ./model_download_scripts/download_models.sh --model <model_id> --type <model_type> --weight-format <model_quantization>
     ```

    **Examples:**

    - For a VLM model:
         ```bash
         /model_download_scripts/download_models.sh --model OpenGVLab/InternVL2-1B --type vlm --weight-format int8
         ```

    - For a YOLO vision model:
         ```bash
         ./model_download_scripts/download_models.sh --model yolov8s --type vision
         ```

    - For more detailed information about the scripts:
         ```bash
         ./model_download_scripts/download_models.sh -h
         ```

6. **Stop the service**:

    This service exclusively handles the downloading and conversion of models needed for the live-video-captioning sample application. It functions independently and is not tied to the operation of the live-video-captioning application. You can stop or terminate the service once the required models have been prepared.
