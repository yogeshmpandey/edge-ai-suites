# Live Video Alert Agent

Deploy AI-powered video alerting using OpenVINO Vision Language Models to process RTSP streams,
generate real-time alerts from natural language prompts, and monitor them on a unified dashboard.

## Use Cases

**Real-time Video Analytics**: Monitor security cameras, industrial equipment, or public spaces with AI-powered scene understanding and automatic alerting.

**Safety Monitoring**: Deploy prompts like "Is there a fire?" or "Is anyone wearing a safety vest?" to trigger immediate visual notifications.

**Custom Alerts**: Use natural language to define what constitutes an alert without retraining a model.

## Key Features

**Dynamic Alert Prompts**: Define and modify "Alerts" (prompts) in real-time through the UI without redeploying.

**Real-time Event Broadcasting**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) deliver instant alerts to the dashboard with low latency.

**Modular Architecture**: Decoupled ingestion, analysis, and event broadcasting for scalability.

**Intel® Hardware Optimized**: Designed for high-performance inference on Intel® CPUs and GPUs via OpenVINO.
