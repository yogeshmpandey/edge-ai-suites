# Live Video Search

**Live Video Search** is a Metro AI Suite sample that adapts the VSS pipeline for semantic search on live Frigate streams. It ingests live camera streams, indexes video segments with embeddings and timestamped camera metadata, and lets users select cameras, time ranges, and free‑text queries to retrieve ranked, playable clips with confidence scores while surfacing live system metrics.

## Get Started

To see the system requirements and other installations, see the following guides:

  - [Get Started](./docs/user-guide/get-started.md): Step‑by‑step setup.
  - [System Requirements](./docs/user-guide/system-requirements.md): Hardware and software requirements.

## How It Works

The diagram shows how video moves from cameras to searchable results and live monitoring. It highlights the main components involved in capturing events, processing clips, and presenting results to users. Each step builds on the previous one to keep video searchable, observable, and easy to use.

## Notes

- Telemetry is **enabled** for this app and shown in the VSS UI when connected.
- Use VSS UI **Configure Cameras** to enable camera feeds for search ingestion.
- Use `source setup.sh --start-usb-camera` to run Frigate with a USB camera input.
