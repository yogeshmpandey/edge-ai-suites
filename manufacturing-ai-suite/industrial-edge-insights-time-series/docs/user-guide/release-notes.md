# Release Notes: Industrial Edge Insights - Time Series

## Version 2026.1

**June 2026**

This release introduces **batch processing UDFs**, **a new ML model for Weld Defect Detection**,
**scikit-learn training scripts for Weld Defect Detection**, and various fixes and documentation
improvements.

**Deprecated:** The Weld Defect Detection Time Series Sample App is deprecated and will be removed in the 2026.2 release.

**New**

- **Batch Processing UDFs**: Batch-mode UDF variants for both Wind Turbine Anomaly
  Detection and Weld Defect Detection are now available, including Kapacitor TICK
  scripts, per-app `config-batch.json`, and `make batch` support for running
  Kapacitor windowed batches. This is enabled primarily for the benchmarking exercise.
- **Weld Defect Detection Training Scripts**: Classification training and inference
  scripts using a scikit-learn (Intel-accelerated) pipeline have been added for the
  Weld Defect Detection sample app.
- **Functional Tests**: Comprehensive functional tests for Docker Compose and Helm deployments have been added.
- **GPU Support for Weld Defect Detection**: Docker Compose and Helm deployments now support
  GPU acceleration for weld defect detection on the Time Series Analytics microservice image, with
  updated configuration and user guides for running inference on GPU.

**Improved**

- **Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection ML Model**: The LinearRegression model has been removed
  from the Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection sample app; RandomForestRegressor (Intel® Extension
  for Scikit-learn) is now the only inference model, with updated training scripts and
  adjusted anomaly scoring thresholds.
- **Weld Defect Detection ML Model**: Weld Defect Detection now uses a
  scikit-learn (Intel-accelerated) classifier model, replacing the previous CatBoost
  classifier, with updated training scripts and model artifacts.
- **Renamed Sample App**: "Weld Anomaly Detection" has been renamed to
  "Weld Defect Detection" across all configurations, documentation, and scripts.
- **UDF Deployment Package Format**: User Defined Function deployment package format for the sample apps will be generated in
  tar format and used to configure Time Series Analytics microservice.
- **Security**: Upgraded to latest available third-party versions in all applicable manifests.
- **Documentation**: Time Series vs Multimodal Weld Defect Detection
  distinction clarified, Weld Defect Detection docs updated for GPU usage, OPC-UA
  alert configuration docs updated, broken references and typos fixed.

## Version 2026.0

**March 2026**

This release introduces **new documentation for UDF development and wind turbine
model integration**, along with **updated service images** and
**documentation improvements**.

**New**

- **UDF Development Guide** — Added a comprehensive guide for writing
  User Defined Functions (UDFs) covering architecture, implementation steps, and
  examples.
- **Wind Turbine Model Guidelines** — Added wind turbine model selection and
  integration guidelines.

**Improved**

- Updated image tags/versioning and aligned deployment/documentation examples.
- Updated third-party service image versions used by Time Series (Telegraf,
  Grafana, Eclipse Mosquitto).
- Reorganized Time Series how-to guides for better navigation.
