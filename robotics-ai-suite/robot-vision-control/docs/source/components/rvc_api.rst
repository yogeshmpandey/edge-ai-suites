PoseStamped
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *obj_id*: unique uint64 identifier for the associated class of the object. 
-  *string obj_type*: string associated to obj_id
-  *geometry_msgs/PoseStamped pose_stamped*: the actual pose
   (position/orientation) of the object, time stamped
-  *builtin_interfaces/Time last_observed*: the last time this object
   was directly observed. If this is before the current time, the object
   record may be extrapolated under the assumption that the cameraâ€™s
   visual field is partially occluded.
-  *geometry_msgs/PoseStamped last_observed_pose_stamped*: the
   world-space pose of the object when it was last observed
