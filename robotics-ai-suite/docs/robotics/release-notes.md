# Release Notes: Autonomous Mobile Robot

## Version 2026.0

**April 01, 2026**

Autonomous Mobile Robot has been updated to fully support ROS 2 Jazzy. This brings latest
generation ROS support on the latest Intel silicon, enabling workloads to take the
advantage of hardware accelerators such as the GPU and NPU.

**New**

- Add support for ROS 2 Jazzy across all components.
- **Warehouse Pick-and-Place Simulation**
  - Gazebo Harmonic simulation enablement
    - Migrate the warehouse pick-and-place simulation that features two manipulators (UR5) and an AMR from Gazebo Classic (Ignition) to Gazebo Harmonic:
    - Simulation launch/config stack was migrated from the older Classic/Ignition-oriented setup to a Harmonic-compatible Gazebo setup.
    - Runtime wiring was updated so Harmonic simulation components, robot descriptions, and bridges launch coherently in a single flow.
  - Plugin migration and compatibility refactor
    - Core custom simulation plugins (notably conveyor and vacuum tooling) were refactored for Harmonic behavior and plugin APIs.
    - SDF/Xacro model integration was updated to match Harmonic expectations, including resource/material compatibility adjustments.
  - Unified TF architecture for pick-and-place
    - A unified tf2-based frame system was introduced for robots and cubes.
    - New odometry-to-TF publishing was added for Harmonic DiffDrive outputs, ensuring downstream planners/controllers consume consistent transforms.
  - Controller logic moved from static offsets to TF-driven tracking
    - Arm controllers were redesigned to track target cubes from the TF tree instead of relying on hardcoded offsets.
    - Dynamic grasp pose resolution was added, improving robustness when robot/cube transforms vary at runtime.
    - Per-robot namespacing support was added for multi-robot controller separation.
  - MoveIt and manipulator control updates
    - Dedicated controller-manager configs were added for each arm.
    - Joint limits/controller config were reorganized for dual-arm operation.
    - MoveIt execution handling was hardened with longer joint-state wait tolerance and better debug behavior.
  - Robot description and tooling additions
    - New gripper/vacuum-related robot description assets were added (parallel gripper and vacuum examples).
    - URDF/SDF/control fragments were aligned to the Harmonic-ready control pipeline.
  - AMR behavior fixes required by migration
    - Navigation orientation conversion (yaw to quaternion) was corrected in AMR motion logic.
    - State-machine flow gained an explicit idle completion path for clean single-cycle demo termination.
  - Packaging and deployment updates for migrated stack
    - DDS configuration was added for runtime communication consistency.
    - Entry-point/package wiring fixes were applied for new nodes.
    - Debian package revisions were bumped to publish the migration changes cleanly.
- **Collaborative SLAM**
  - Add a safe build option and update documentation for memory management:
    - Prevention of system crashes on memory-constrained systems.
    - Support for oneAPI 2025.x/SYCL 8 development.
    - Added optional support for local ORB extractor package input during safe builds to improve compatibility with oneAPI/SYCL version requirements.
    - Updated third-party `g2o` source integration to use the ROS release repository and added explicit `libg2o` build configuration for Jazzy packaging.
    - Fully backward compatible.
  - Add the troubleshooting guide.
- **Orb-Extractor**
  - Resolved memory issues in `liborb`, improving stability and reliability under load.
  - Updated SYCL compatibility for Intel 2025.3 and introduced targeted code optimizations.
  - Introduce compatibility checks and adjustments for `OPENCV_FREE` mode in various test files.
- **ITS Planner**
  - Implemented automatic ROS distribution detection across the build and deployment pipeline
  - Updated all configuration files and documentation to support both ROS 2 Humble and Jazzy distributions
  - Added distro-specific environment variable handling `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` vs `GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH`
  - Enhanced launch scripts with distro-aware package path resolution and configuration management
  - Added distribution-specific nav2 parameter files for optimized performance across ROS versions
  - Removed hardcoded distribution references from documentation and build scripts
- **ADBScan**
  - Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic support enabled
    - Added and updated simulation, launch, model, packaging, and documentation assets to support ROS 2 Jazzy with Gazebo Harmonic.
    - Expanded follow-me simulation coverage across lidar, RealSense, gesture, and audio-assisted launch paths.
  - OpenVINO 2024 compatibility updates
    - Updated audio recognition components and related scripts/configuration to support OpenVINO 2024.
    - Applied changelog updates across multiple packages to reflect OpenVINO 2024 compatibility and related improvements.
  - Dependency and packaging fixes
    - Corrected Humble dependency definitions in simulation package metadata.
    - Updated Debian changelog/control-related package maintenance entries for both Humble and Jazzy package sets.
- **ROS2 KPI**
  - Introduced `ros2-kpi` (v0.1.0), a new monitoring and analysis framework for ROS2 systems.
  - Real-time ROS2 graph monitoring: nodes, topics, message rates, and processing delays across the full pipeline.
  - Automatic per-node input→output latency measurement for every node in the graph — no `--node` filter required.
  - CPU, memory, and I/O monitoring via `pidstat` with support for both thread-level and PID-only modes.
  - Cross-machine remote monitoring via SSH and DDS peer discovery (`--remote-ip`).
  - Interactive visualizations: heatmaps, timelines, core utilization, and scatter plots.
  - ROS bag analysis with per-topic latency tracking and CPU-cycle estimation.
  - Grafana dashboard integration with a Prometheus metrics exporter.
  - Unified entry point (`monitor_stack.py`) and an interactive `quickstart` launcher for guided onboarding.
  - Supports ROS2 Humble and Jazzy.

**Improved**

- **Robot configuration (robot_config)**
  - Refactor robot configuration for Gazebo Harmonic compatibility.
  - Update nav2 launch files (humble/jazzy/foxy), warehouse launch, and AMR launch.
  - Update TurtleBot3 waffle SDF models (standard, tray+camera, tray no-camera variants).
- **Pick-and-Place Controllers (picknplace)**
  - Replace hardcoded coordinate offsets in arm1_controller with TF tree lookups (`tf2_ros`).
  - `GRASP_Y_ARM` is now dynamically resolved at startup via the live TF tree with a fallback.
  - Cube tracking uses `lookup_transform` rather than manual subtraction.
  - Increase QoS depth from 1 to 10 in moveit2.
- **Debian Packaging**
  - Bump package versions: robot-config 2.3-2, picknplace 2.3-2, robot-config-plugins 3.6-2.
- **Orb-extractor**
  - Update build dependencies in the control files for Intel oneAPI DPC++ Compiler to version 2025.3.
  - Remove redundant `libgpu_orb.so` from the package installation files.
  - Adjust the test installation files to skip problematic test targets.
  - Refactor debian/rules to streamline the build process and remove redundant test builds.
  - Enhance the SYCL code to resolve namespace qualification issues and internal implementation errors.
  - Apply the aggressive clean build approach for the SYCL compilation.
  - Update `CMakeLists.txt` to reflect changes in library linking and compiler settings.
  - Modify test source files to accommodate changes in OpenCV compatibility and removed
    deprecated OpenCV includes.
  - Increase Device count.
  - Use direct memory allocation instead of memory pool for increased stability.
- **ITS Planner**
  - Update all README files to support both Humble and Jazzy distributions.
  - Update the launch scripts with distro-aware package paths and configurations.
  - Enhance the nav2 parameter files with distro-specific settings.

  - Improve the `collab_slam` script with automatic ROS environment detection.
- **ADBScan**
  - Update `CMakeLists.txt` to support both Humble and Jazzy with Gazebo Harmonic on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 respectively.

**Fixed**

- **Debian Packaging**
  - Fix debian/rules executable permissions (from 644 to 755) across all packages
    (required by dpkg-buildpackage).
- **Orb-Extractor**
  - Fix a memory leak.
- **Pick-and-Place Controllers (picknplace)**
  - Fix node namespace - from `/ARM2Controller` to `/arm2/ARM2Controller`.
  - Fix `amr_goto_pose` in amr_controller to use proper yaw-to-quaternion conversion:
    (`sin(yaw/2)`, `cos(yaw/2)`) instead of `raw z=0.004`.
