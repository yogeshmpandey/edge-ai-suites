# OpenVINO™ Tutorial with Segmentation

This tutorial serves as an example for understanding the utilization of the ROS 2 OpenVINO™ node.
It outlines the steps for installing and executing the semantic segmentation model using the ROS 2 OpenVINO™ toolkit.
This tutorial uses the Intel® RealSense™ camera image as input and performs inference on CPU, GPU devices.

## Prerequisites

Complete the [get started guide](../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) before continuing.

## Install OpenVINO™ tutorial packages

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-segmentation-realsense-tutorial
```

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-segmentation-realsense-tutorial
```

## Run Demo with Intel® RealSense™ Camera Topic Input

Run one of the following commands to launch the segmentation tutorial with a specific inference engine:

- GPU inference engine

  ```bash
  ros2 launch segmentation_realsense_tutorial openvino_segmentation.launch.py device:=GPU
  ```

- CPU inference engine

  ```bash
  ros2 launch segmentation_realsense_tutorial openvino_segmentation.launch.py device:=CPU
  ```

> **Note:** If no device is specified, the GPU is selected by default as inference engine.

Once the tutorial is started, the ``deeplabv3`` model is downloaded, converted into IR files,
and the inference process begins, utilizing the input from the Intel® RealSense™ camera.

To exit the application, press ``Ctrl-c`` in the terminal where the launch script was executed.
