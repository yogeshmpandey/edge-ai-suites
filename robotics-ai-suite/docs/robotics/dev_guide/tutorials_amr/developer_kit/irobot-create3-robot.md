# iRobot Create 3

iRobot Create 3 is a mobile robotics platform, which developers can use
to gain hands-on experience with the technologies and concepts that are
foundational to the field of autonomous mobile robots. This practical
understanding is invaluable for those looking to enter the robotics
industry or further their knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.

Before starting, review the [iRobot Create 3 mobile robotics platform documentation](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/) to be able to
perform the configuration changes needed for the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Complete the [GSG Robot Guide](../../../gsg_robot/index.md) before continuing.

## iRobot Create 3 hardware extensions

iRobot Create 3 contains a compute unit running ROS 2 that provides
access to the on-board sensors and actuators. For this tutorial, the
following modifications have been applied to the robot:

- two support layers added on top of the robot,

- Intel® board mounted on the bottom layer,

- Intel® RealSense™ camera mounted on the front of the top layer and
  connected to a USB port on the Intel® board,

- Slamtec RPLIDAR 2D ([Slamtec RPLIDAR A3 laser range scanner](https://www.slamtec.ai/product/slamtec-rplidar-a3) or [Slamtec RPLIDAR A2 laser range scanner (A2M8)](https://www.slamtec.ai/product/slamtec-rplidar-a2)) sensor on a mount in the center of the
  top layer and connected to two USB ports on the Intel® board,

- custom battery in the cargo bay to power the Intel® board and
  accessories, namely the camera and the lidar,

- an Ethernet adapter connected to the iRobot Create 3 adapter board
  and to the Intel® board,

- a rear caster wheel attached to the cargo bay, as described in the
  [iRobot® Create® 3 Mechanical System](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/hw/mechanical/) documentation.

### iRobot Create 3 software configuration

Update the robot to use the latest ROS 2 firmware for your selected OS distribution, and configure it
to access your WiFi network following the
[iRobot® Create® 3 Setup](https://edu.irobot.com/create3-setup) documentation.

With the robot connected to your WiFi network continue configuring it
using its web interface. Refer to the [iRobot Create 3 mobile robotics platform documentation](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/) for the exact
steps to follow.

#### Wired (Ethernet) network

The Intel® board and the compute unit of the iRobot Create 3 should be
connected using an Ethernet adapter with a USB Type-C connector. The
USB Type-C plug should be connected to the adapter board of the
iRobot Create 3, while the Intel® board should be connected to the
Ethernet adapter using an RJ-45 cable.

![IR3 Ethernet Connection](../../../images/iRobot/iRobot-Create-3-Ethernet-connection.jpg)

   Ethernet via USB connection between iRobot Create 3  adapter board
   and Intel® board.

The iRobot Create 3 robot is configured to use the address
``192.168.186.2/24`` on the USB interface. You can change the network
part of the address by following the instructions on page
[iRobot Create 3 Webserver - Set Wired Subnet](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/webserver/set-wired-subnet).

On the Intel® board, the network interface connected to the robot
has to be configured with a static IP address of the same subnet.

#### NTP server

Time synchronization is very important in ROS 2. For this reason, the
iRobot Create 3 includes an NTP server, which can be configured as described on page
[iRobot® Create® 3 Webserver - Edit ntp.conf](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/webserver/edit-ntp-conf).

Alternatively, you can set up an NTP server on the Intel® board by following
the iRobot Create 3 documentation [Set up NTP on compute board](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/setup/compute-ntp/).
Use the IP address of the Ethernet interface connected to the robot.

#### ROS 2 Middleware (RMW) Configuration & Fast DDS discovery server

To define what ROS 2 middleware implementation shall be used by the
iRobot Create 3, follow the configuration guidelines on page
[iRobot Create 3 Webserver - Application](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/webserver/application/).
Set the RMW_IMPLEMENTATION option to ``rmw_fastrtps_cpp``, as shown in
the figure below.

![IR3 ROS Configuration](../../../images/iRobot/iRobot-create3-ROS-configuration.png)

   iRobot Create 3 ROS 2 application configuration page. On this
   robot the [iRobot Create 3 Webserver - Set Wired Subnet](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/webserver/set-wired-subnet/)
   is set to ``192.168.99.2``, Fast DDS discovery server is enabled
   and runs on the Intel® board reachable at IP ``192.168.99.10``
   over the Ethernet connection. ROS 2 Domain ID is set but it is not
   used when the discovery server is enabled.

To speed up node discovery, enable the
[iRobot® Create® 3 Fast DDS Discovery Server](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/setup/discovery-server/).
Use the IP address set above for the Intel® board on the USB
connection to the iRobot Create 3 as the Fast DDS Discovery Server IP
address.

> **Note:** When the discovery server is enabled, the ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is not used.

#### Robot namespace

Set a ROS 2 namespace (e.g., ``/robot2``) for your robot, as described on page
[iRobot Create 3 Webserver - Application](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/webserver/application/). This value should be passed to the
launch file as argument ``irobot_ns``.
