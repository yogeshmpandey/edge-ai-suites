AAEON Robotic Kits
##################

The AAEON UP Xtreme* i11 & UP Squared* 6000 Robotic Development Kits are delivered with the |intel| Edge Insights for Autonomous Mobile Robots software preinstalled.
This is a legacy version of the |lp_amr|. The devices may give you a good start to get familiar with an autonomous robotic system.
To get detailed information on the hardware of these robotic kits,
check out the up-board.org page:
`UP Xtreme i11 & UP Squared 6000 Robotic Development Kits <https://up-board.org/up-xtreme-i11-up-squared-6000-robotic-development-kits>`__.


Using the AAEON kit with the latest |lp_amr|
---------------------------------------------

After you have created a back-up of the legacy software on the robotic kit
and verified that the robot is functioning properly,
you are free to start over with a fresh OS installation to set up the robot system
with the latest |lp_amr| release.
Just follow our :doc:`../../../gsg_robot/index` from installation of Ubuntu, ROS software to the |p_amr|.
Since release 2.0 the new |deb_pack| based SDK contains all the software required to run on an AAEON robotic kit. It also includes a number of additional tutorials.
