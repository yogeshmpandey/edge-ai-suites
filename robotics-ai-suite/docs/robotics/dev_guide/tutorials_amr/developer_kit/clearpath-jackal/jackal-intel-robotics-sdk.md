# Install the Autonomous Mobile Robot on Jackal Robot's Onboard Computer

This section shows how to install the Autonomous Mobile Robot with the
ROS 2 middleware and the Clearpath Robotics ecosystem, on
the Clearpath Robotics Jackal robot's onboard computer.

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

The Jackal robot runs Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) and ROS 2 Jazzy
for this configuration. Intel provides a setup script that installs all
required Intel and Clearpath software repositories and packages.

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

The Jackal robot is equipped with an onboard
computer that has a pre-installed Canonical Ubuntu 22.04 LTS OS,
ROS 2 Humble distribution, and the Clearpath Robotics software packages.

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

Intel recommends using the pre-installed software for the initial bring-up
of your Jackal robot. During the initial bring-up, you must update
the firmware of the MCU; see the
[Robot Installation](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot/)
page of the Clearpath Robotics documentation.

Intel recommends creating a backup of the default software installation
or replace the pre-installed SATA M.2 SSD with an empty storage device,
before continuing with the next steps.

## Install ROS 2 Distribution and Autonomous Mobile Robot

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

1. Set the hostname to match the robot serial number:

   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname cpr-j100-<serial>
   ```

1. Run the Intel Robotics setup script, which installs all required
   repositories (ROS 2, Clearpath, Intel ECI/AMR, librealsense) and packages:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/refs/heads/main/robotics-ai-suite/scripts/setup-robotics-jazzy.sh
   chmod +x setup-robotics-jazzy.sh
   ./setup-robotics-jazzy.sh
   ```

1. To install the Autonomous Mobile Robot on the Clearpath Robotics Jackal robot,
   see the [GSG Robot Guide](../../../../gsg_robot/index.md).

1. Create an account with the username ``administrator`` when
   installing the Canonical Ubuntu OS, or create and set its group membership
   as follows:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser administrator
   sudo usermod -a -G sudo administrator
   ```

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

1. To install the ROS 2 Humble distribution and the Autonomous Mobile Robot on the
Clearpath Robotics Jackal robot, see the
[GSG Robot Guide](../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) of the Autonomous Mobile Robot.

1. Create an account with the username ``administrator``when
installing the Canonical Ubuntu OS, or create and set its group membership
as follows:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser administrator
   sudo usermod -a -G sudo administrator
   ```

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

## Install the Clearpath Robotics Software Packages

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

Install the ROS 2 development tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-dev-tools
```

Install the required Clearpath and Nav2 packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  ros-jazzy-clearpath-robot \
  ros-jazzy-clearpath-firmware \
  ros-jazzy-micro-ros-agent \
  ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup \
  ros-jazzy-rtabmap-ros \
  ros-jazzy-realsense2-camera \
  ros-jazzy-librealsense2-tools
```

Reload udev rules so the ``/dev/clearpath/j100`` device node is created:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Pin Package Versions

Version mismatches between ``librealsense2`` and ``ros-jazzy-realsense2-camera``
cause silent communication failures. Pin the following working versions:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/librealsense > /dev/null <<'EOF'
Package: librealsense2*
Pin: version 2.56.5-0~realsense.17055
Pin-Priority: 1001

Package: ros-jazzy-librealsense2*
Pin: version 2.56.4*
Pin-Priority: 1001

Package: ros-jazzy-realsense2*
Pin: version 4.56.4*
Pin-Priority: 1001
EOF
```

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/oneapi > /dev/null <<'EOF'
Package: intel-oneapi-runtime-*
Pin: version 2025.3.*
Pin-Priority: 1001

Package: intel-oneapi-compiler-*
Pin: version 2025.3.*
Pin-Priority: 1001

Package: intel-oneapi-mkl-*
Pin: version 2025.3.*
Pin-Priority: 1001
EOF
```

Then re-run ``sudo apt-get install`` from above to ensure pinned versions
are installed.

### Build clearpath_ws from Source (micro-ROS Agent Fix)

The binary ``ros-jazzy-micro-ros-agent`` ships with a ``libmicroxrcedds_agent.so``
that conflicts with the version expected by the Clearpath platform. Build
the workspace from source and copy the corrected library:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/clearpath_ws/src && cd ~/clearpath_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_robot/jazzy/dependencies.repos
vcs import src < dependencies.repos
git clone https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-Agent.git src/micro-ROS-Agent
rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro jazzy \
  --skip-keys="flir_ptu_description flir_ptu_driver flir_ptu_viz"
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Copy the built library to the system ROS install:

```bash
sudo cp ~/clearpath_ws/install/micro_ros_agent/lib/libmicroxrcedds_agent.so.2.4.3 \
        /opt/ros/jazzy/lib/libmicroxrcedds_agent.so.2.4.3
```

Add the workspace overlay to the Clearpath platform environment so all
systemd services pick it up:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/clearpath/setup.bash /etc/clearpath/setup.bash.bak
echo 'source /home/intel/clearpath_ws/install/setup.bash' | sudo tee -a /etc/clearpath/setup.bash
```

<!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
<!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

Install the ROS 2 development tools, which comprises the compilers
and other tools to build ROS 2 packages. See the official
[ROS 2 Installation Instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-dev-tools
```

See the [Package Install](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot/#package-install)
section of the Clearpath Robotics documentation. You can install the software through one of these methods:

- [Option 1: Install Script](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot/#option-1-install-script),
  which uses an automated installer.
- [Option 2: Manual Source Install](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot/#option-2-manual-source-install),
  which provides detailed instructions on how to install the software with a higher flexibility.

## Create Your Robot Configuration

This section shows how to create the ``robot.yaml`` configuration
file for your Jackal robot with the RealSense™ camera D435i. Ensure
to complete the
[Install the Clearpath Robotics Software Packages](#install-the-clearpath-robotics-software-packages)
steps.

### Identify the Serial Number of your RealSense™ Camera

You need to include the serial number of the RealSense™ camera to the
``robot.yaml`` file.

> **Note:** Do not run ``lsusb -v`` to get the serial number because the serial number displayed might differ from the true serial number.

1. To get the serial number, connect the camera
   to the onboard computer of the Jackal robot and run:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py
   ```

   The output of this command will print the serial number. The serial
   number of the camera in the example below is ``207522xxxx38`` (some digits
   are masked here to preserve confidentiality).

   ```console
   [realsense2_camera_node-1] [INFO] [1709051840.999128954] [camera.camera]: RealSense ROS v4.54.1
   [realsense2_camera_node-1] [INFO] [1709051840.999193090] [camera.camera]: Built with LibRealSense v2.55.0
   [realsense2_camera_node-1] [INFO] [1709051840.999200850] [camera.camera]: Running with LibRealSense v2.55.0
   [realsense2_camera_node-1] [INFO] [1709051841.005234011] [camera.camera]: Device with serial number 207522xxxx38 was found.
   ```

1. Stop the command by pressing ``Ctrl-c``.

### Create your Robot YAML File

1. To configure the ``robot.yaml`` file for your Jackal robot, see the
[Robot YAML Overview](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/config/yaml/overview/)
section of the Clearpath Robotics documentation.

1. You can use the example configuration
[j100_sample.yaml](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_config/blob/main/clearpath_config/sample/j100/j100_sample.yaml)
in the Clearpath Robotics [configuration repository](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_config):

   Edit the ``serial_number`` and ``system`` sections in the j100_sample.yaml file as follows:

   - Change the ``serial_number`` to the serial
     number of your robot, for example ``j100-1234``.
   - In the ``system/hosts`` section, change the ``hostname`` to the
     hostname of the onboard computer of your Jackal robot.
   - In the ``system/hosts`` section, change the ``ip`` address to the
     IP address of your Jackal robot, either a static address or
     a dynamic address that is assigned by the router of your network.
   - In the ``system/ros2`` section, set the ``namespace`` string.

     <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
     <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
     <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

     For ROS 2 Jazzy with the Clearpath platform, use the robot serial
     number as the namespace (without a leading slash), for example
     ``namespace: j100_0123``. This namespace is used as the prefix for
     all platform and sensor topics, and must match the namespace
     configured in the MCU (see [Flash Firmware and Configure the MCU](#flash-firmware-and-configure-the-mcu)).

     <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
     <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
     <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

     Intel recommends using an empty namespace as used in the Autonomous
     Mobile Robot tutorials. An empty namespace is indicated by a slash
     character: ``namespace: /``

     <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
     <!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

   - In the ``system/ros2`` section, add the ``domain_id`` entry and set it
     to a value that does not conflict with the ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` of
     other ROS 2 installations in your neighborhood. The value that you
     use here will be propagated into the ``/etc/clearpath/setup.bash`` script.
     The ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` environment variable will be set to the value
     you defined here.

     > **Note (Jazzy):** The ``wandering_jackal.sh`` script always reads
     > ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` directly from ``/etc/clearpath/robot.yaml`` to
     > ensure it matches the MCU configuration, overriding any value set
     > in ``setup.bash``.
   - If you have used the manual installation option in the
     [Install Clearpath Software Packages](#install-the-clearpath-robotics-software-packages)
     section, add the ``workspaces`` entry
     to the ``system/ros2`` section. This entry provides a list of setup
     scripts that need to be sourced. Provide the path to the ``setup.bash``
     script of the workspace that was created when you executed the steps in the
     [Option 2: Manual Source Install](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/installation/robot/#option-2-manual-source-install)
     section. The path of this script is
     ``/home/administrator/clearpath_ws/install/setup.bash``

   Details on these configuration entries are provided on the
   [System](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/config/yaml/system/)
   section of the Clearpath Robotics documentation. As an example,
   the following listing shows the first sections of the ``robot.yaml`` file:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   > ```yaml
   > serial_number: j100-<serial>      # e.g. j100-0812
   > version: 0
   > system:
   >   hosts:
   >     - hostname: cpr-j100-<serial>  # must match hostnamectl
   >   username: intel
   >   ros2:
   >     namespace: j100_<serial>       # e.g. j100_0812  (no leading slash)
   >     domain_id: 42                  # must match MCU configuration
   > platform:
   >   ...
   > ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   > ```yaml
   > serial_number: j100-1234
   > version: 0
   > system:
   >   hosts:
   >     - hostname: jackal-cfls-01
   >       ip: 192.168.1.78
   >   ros2:
   >     namespace: /
   >     domain_id: 68
   >     workspaces:
   >       - /home/administrator/clearpath_ws/install/setup.bash
   > platform:
   >   ...
   > ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

1. Copy the ``robot.yaml`` file
   to the ``/etc/clearpath/`` folder on the onboard computer of your
   Jackal robot.

1. If your ``~/.bashrc`` script defines a ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` environment variable,
   remove this definition. This variable will be
   set by the ``/etc/clearpath/setup.bash`` script according to the ``domain_id``
   value that you have defined in the ``robot.yaml`` file.

After you have installed the Clearpath Robotics software packages and
configured your ``robot.yaml`` file, you can run
``ros2 node list`` and ``ros2 topic list`` to verify that
the Clearpath Robotics services have started the Jackal-specific ROS 2
nodes, so that the related ROS 2 topics are published.

### Add your RealSense™ Camera D435i to the Robot YAML File

You need to define a camera in the ``sensors`` section of your robot.yaml file.

1. The [Sensors/Cameras](https://docs.clearpathrobotics.com/docs/ros/config/yaml/sensors/cameras)
   section of the Clearpath Robotics documentation shows an example of the
   data structure that defines a RealSense™ camera instance.

   Intel recommends adding the following ``camera`` configuration as the first device in the
   ``sensors`` section. This configuration has been tested with
   the Autonomous Mobile Robot:

   > ```yaml
   > sensors:
   >   camera:
   >   - model: intel_realsense
   >     urdf_enabled: true
   >     launch_enabled: true
   >     parent: base_link
   >     xyz: [0.21, 0.0, 0.19]
   >     rpy: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
   >     ros_parameters:
   >       camera:
   >         camera_name: camera_0
   >         device_type: d435i
   >         serial_no: "207522xxxx38"
   >         enable_color: true
   >         rgb_camera.profile: 640,480,30
   >         enable_depth: true
   >         depth_module.profile: 640,480,30
   >         pointcloud.enable: true
   >         enable_infra1: true
   >         align_depth.enable: true
   >         enable_sync: true
   >         initial_reset: true
   > ```

   In comparison to the example data structure in the Clearpath Robotics documentation,
   the following items were changed:

   - The ``xyz`` position of the ``camera`` joint, relative to the ``base_link``
     has been set to ``[0.21, 0.0, 0.19]``. This means that the camera sits above
     the front fender of the Jackal robot as shown in the following figure:

     ![jackal_with_camera2](../../../../images/jackal_with_camera2.png)

     This figure is rendered through the rviz2 tool using the TF data
     published by the Clearpath Robotics services running on the robot.

   - The ``device_type`` has been set to ``d435i``.

   - The ``serial_no`` has been replaced with the actual serial number of the
     camera, which can be identified as described in the
     [Identify RealSense Camera Serial Number](#identify-the-serial-number-of-your-realsense-camera) section.

   - The following features have been enabled:
     ``enable_infra1``, ``align_depth.enable``, ``enable_sync``, and ``initial_reset``.

1. Copy the ``robot.yaml`` file to the ``/etc/clearpath/`` folder on the onboard computer
   of your Jackal robot.

1. Reboot the robot to propagate the new configuration.

## Flash Firmware and Configure the MCU

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

1. Flash the MCU firmware:

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   ros2 run clearpath_robot install
   ```

   The robot must be powered on and ``/dev/clearpath/j100`` must be accessible.
   Verify the device node exists:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/clearpath/j100
   ```

1. After flashing, write the ``domain_id`` and robot namespace into the MCU
   so it uses the correct FastDDS domain and topic prefix on next boot.
   Replace ``<serial>`` and ``<domain_id>`` with the values from your
   ``robot.yaml``:

   ```bash
   source /etc/clearpath/setup.bash

   ros2 service call /j100_<serial>/platform/mcu/configure \
     clearpath_platform_msgs/srv/ConfigureMcu \
     "{domain_id: <domain_id>, robot_namespace: 'j100_<serial>'}"
   ```

1. Restart the platform service to apply the new MCU configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart clearpath-platform
   ```

> **Note:** Do **not** delete ``/dev/shm/fastrtps_*`` files. Clearpath
> platform and sensor services own these FastDDS shared-memory segments.
> Deleting them while the robot services are running will crash all robot nodes.

## Verify the Robot Configuration

### Verify the Frames of the TF2 Tree

1. If not already installed, install the ROS2 TF2 Tools:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash

   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-humble-tf2-tools
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

1. Verify that the robot state publisher communicates the correct TF2 tree:

   ```bash
   ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
   ```

   This command listens to the frames that are broadcast over the ROS 2
   middleware, and generates a PDF file that shows how the robot's frames are connected.
   Open the PDF file and verify that the TF2 tree contains the ``camera_0_link``
   and its children, as shown in the following figures:

   ![frames_jackal_2024-02-28](../../../../images/frames_jackal_2024-02-28.png)

1. Complete TF2 tree of the Jackal robot with RealSense™ camera.
   To increase the figure, right-click on the image and open the image
   in a new browser tab. The following figure shows the TF2 tree of the Jackal robot,
   with a detailed view on the camera_0_link:

   ![frames_jackal_camera_2024-02-28](../../../../images/frames_jackal_camera_2024-02-28.png)

### Verify the ROS 2 Topics

1. Run

   ```bash
   ros2 topic list
   ```

1. Verify that the required ROS 2 topics are published:

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   > **Note:** On Jazzy, all platform and sensor topics are prefixed with
   > the robot namespace, e.g. ``/j100_<serial>/``. The following list uses
   > ``/j100_0123/`` as an example. Camera topics also depend on the
   > installed ``ros-jazzy-realsense2-camera`` version (4.55 vs 4.54).

## Jackal Troubleshooting

If the output of the ``ros2 topic list`` command does not show any topics,
check that ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` matches the value in ``/etc/clearpath/robot.yaml``:

```bash
grep domain_id /etc/clearpath/robot.yaml
echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID
```

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
<!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

Ensure ``ROBOT_NAMESPACE`` is set before running any wandering scripts:

```bash
export ROBOT_NAMESPACE=/j100_<serial>
```

Verify the MCU is communicating by checking the platform status:

```bash
source /etc/clearpath/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo /j100_<serial>/platform/mcu/status --once
```

If the MCU topic is not publishing, check that no manual
``micro_ros_agent`` process is holding the serial port and restart
the platform service:

```bash
pkill -f micro_ros_agent
sudo systemctl restart clearpath-platform
```

> **FastDDS shared memory:** Do **not** delete ``/dev/shm/fastrtps_*``
> files while the robot services are running. If you need to clear stale
> segments after a crash, stop all clearpath services first:
>
> ```bash
> sudo systemctl stop clearpath-platform
> rm -f /dev/shm/fastrtps_*
> sudo systemctl start clearpath-platform
> ```

If ROS 2 topics are missing (see the [verify ROS topics](#verify-the-ros-2-topics) section),
check whether the required services are up and running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status clearpath-platform.service clearpath-sensors.service clearpath-robot.service
```

If any of these services are not active (running), check the systemd journal:

```bash
sudo journalctl -b | grep clearpath
```
