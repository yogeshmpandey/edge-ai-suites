Robot Kits
======================

To run our tutorials on a real robot, you can use your own robot with |ros| support. The chapter :doc:`create-your-robot-kit` will provide you information on how start using it with the |lp_amr|.

For convenience, you can also use a robotic kit that supports the |ros| operating system and add the |lp_AMR| to it by following the :doc:`../../../gsg_robot/index`.

Check out the :doc:`clearpath-jackal-robot` tutorial to see how we applied the |lp_AMR| to the |jackal| robot.

You can also have a look at the :doc:`AAEON a robotic kit <legacy-aaeon-developer-kit>`, which comes with a preinstalled "Edge Insights for Autonomous Mobile Robots" software (the legacy version of the |lp_amr|) and is used in many of the |lp_amr| tutorials.
