# Follow-me with ADBSCAN, Gesture and Audio Control

This demo of the Follow-me algorithm shows a Autonomous Mobile Robot application
for following a target person where the movement of the robot can be controlled
by the person's location, hand gestures as well as audio command. The entire
pipeline diagram can be found in the [Simulation Demos](../index.rst) page.

It takes point cloud sensor (2D Lidar/depth camera) as well as RGB camera image
as inputs. These inputs are passed through Intel®-patented Adaptive DBScan and
a deep-learning-based gesture recognition pipeline, respectively to publish
motion command messages for a differential drive robot. It also takes recorded
audio commands for starting and stopping the robot movement. Moreover, the demo
is equipped with a text-to-speech synthesis model to narrate the robot's
activity over the course of its movement.

This demo has been tested and validated on 13th Generation Intel® Core™
processors with Intel® Iris® Xe Integrated Graphics and 12th Generation
Intel® Core™ processors with Intel® Iris® Xe Integrated Graphics.
This tutorial describes how to launch the demo in the `Gazebo` simulator.

![follow_me_demo_gazebo_rviz](../../../../../images/follow_me_demo_gazebo_rviz.png)

- The green square robot is a guide robot (namely, the target), which will
  follow a pre-defined trajectory.
- The gray circular robot is a
  [TurtleBot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation)
  robot, which will follow the guide robot.

  TurtleBot3 robot is equipped with a 2D Lidar and an RealSense™ Depth Camera.
  In this demo, the 2D Lidar is selected as the point cloud input.

In this demo, we used a pre-defined trajectory for the guide robot and published
gesture image as well as pre-recorded audio at different points of time to show
`start`, `follow` and `stop` activities of the TurtleBot3 robot.

After the command is executed, you will view that the guide robot
starts moving towards TurtleBot3 robot.
To start the TurtleBot3 robot, condition 1 and either one of the conditions 2 or 3
from the following list needs to be true:

1. The target (guide robot) is located within the tracking radius of the TurtleBot3 robot.
   Radius is a reconfigurable parameter in:
   `/opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/adbscan_sub_2D.yaml`).

   In ROS 2 Humble, the file is located at the similar directory path.

2. The gesture (visualized in the `/image` topic in ROS 2 rviz2) of the target is `thumbs up`.
3. The detected audio from the recording is `Start Following`.

The stop condition for the TurtleBot3 robot is fulfilled when any one of the
following conditions holds true:

1. The target (guide robot) moves to a distance of more than the tracking radius of
   the TurtleBot3 robot. Radius is a reconfigurable parameter in:
   `/opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/adbscan_sub_2D.yaml`.

   In ROS 2 Humble, the file is located at the similar directory path.

2. The gesture (visualized in the `/image` topic in ROS 2 rviz2) of the target is `thumbs down`.
3. The detected audio from the recording is `Stop Following`.

The demo will narrate the detected gesture, audio and target location during
the `start` and `stop` activity of the TurtleBot3 robot.

> **Note**:
>
> The current version of the demo only supports `Start`, `Stop`, `Start Following`
> and `Stop Following` audio commands. If the detected audio does not match any of the
> supported commands, the audio control will be ignored and the movement of the robot
> will be determined by the remaining criteria. Similarly, hand gesture control will
> be ignored if it does not match `thumbs up` or `thumbs down`.
> Thereby, any undesired manipulation of the robot is blocked.

## Run Demo with RealSense™ Camera

Please make sure to source the `/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` file (or `/opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`)
at first before executing any command in a new terminal.
You can get more details in [Prepare the Target System](../../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) page.

Run the following script to launch Gazebo simulator and ROS 2 rviz2.

<!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
<!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/ros/jazzy/share/followme_turtlebot3_gazebo/scripts/demo_RS_audio.sh

You will see two panels side-by-side: Gazebo GUI on the left and ROS 2 rviz display on the right.

![follow_me_demo_gazebo_rviz](../../../../../images/follow_me_demo_gazebo_rviz.png)

After the command is executed, you will observe similar behavior of
the TurtleBot3 robot and guide robot in the `Gazebo` GUI as in
[Run Demo with 2D Lidar](#run-demo-with-2d-lidar).

There are reconfigurable parameters in the
`/opt/ros/jazzy/share/adbscan_ros2_follow_me/config/` directory for both LIDAR
(`adbscan_sub_2D.yaml`) and RealSense™ camera (`adbscan_sub_RS.yaml`).

The user can modify the parameters depending on the respective robot, sensor
configuration and environments (if required) before running the tutorial.
Find a brief description of the parameters in the following list:

- ``Lidar_type``

  Type of the point cloud sensor. For RealSense™ camera and LIDAR inputs,
  the default value is set to ``RS`` and ``2D``, respectively.

- ``Lidar_topic``

  Name of the topic publishing point cloud data.

- ``Verbose``

  If this flag is set to ``True``, the locations of the detected target objects
  will be printed as the screen log.

- ``subsample_ratio``

  This is the downsampling rate of the original point cloud data. Default value
  = 15 (i.e. every 15-th data in the original point cloud is sampled and passed
  to the core ADBSCAN algorithm).

- ``x_filter_back``

  Point cloud data with x-coordinate > ``x_filter_back`` are filtered out
  (positive x direction lies in front of the robot).

- ``y_filter_left``, ``y_filter_right``

  Point cloud data with y-coordinate > ``y_filter_left`` and y-coordinate <
  ``y_filter_right`` are filtered out (positive y-direction is to the left of
  robot and vice versa).

- ``z_filter``

  Point cloud data with z-coordinate < ``z_filter`` will be filtered out. This
  option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``Z_based_ground_removal``

  Filtering in the z-direction will be applied only if this value is non-zero.
  This option will be ignored in case of 2D Lidar.

- ``base``, ``coeff_1``, ``coeff_2``, ``scale_factor``

  These are the coefficients used to calculate adaptive parameters of the
  ADBSCAN algorithm. These values are pre-computed and recommended
  to keep unchanged.

- ``init_tgt_loc``

  This value describes the initial target location. The person needs to be at a
  distance of ``init_tgt_loc`` in front of the robot to initiate the motor.

- ``max_dist``

  This is the maximum distance that the robot can follow. If the person moves at
  a distance > ``max_dist``, the robot will stop following.

- ``min_dist``

  This value describes the safe distance the robot will always maintain with the
  target person. If the person moves closer than ``min_dist``,
  the robot stops following.

- ``max_linear``

  Maximum linear velocity of the robot.

- ``max_angular``

  Maximum angular velocity of the robot.

- ``max_frame_blocked``

  The robot will keep following the target for ``max_frame_blocked`` number of
  frames in the event of a temporary occlusion.

- ``tracking_radius``

  The robot will keep following the target as long as the current target
  location = previous location +/- ``tracking_radius``

## Troubleshooting

- Failed to install Deb package: Please make sure to run `sudo apt update` before
  installing the necessary Deb packages.

- Please make sure to prepare your environment before executing ROS 2 commands in
  a new terminal. You can find the instructions in the
  [Prepare the Target System](../../../../../gsg_robot/index.md) page.

- You can stop the demo anytime by pressing `ctrl-C`. If the `Gazebo` simulator
  freezes or does not stop, please use the following command in a terminal:

  ```bash
  sudo killall -9 gazebo gzserver gzclient
  ```

- We used `simpleaudio` python library to playback audio. The necessary
  dependencies are installed in the
  [install prerequisite libraries](#install-pre-requisite-libraries) step.

  Please make sure that the system microphones are available and unmuted in
  order to listen to played audio during the demo.
