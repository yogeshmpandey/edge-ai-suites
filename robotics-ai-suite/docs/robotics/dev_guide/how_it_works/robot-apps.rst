Autonomous Mobile Robot Applications
-------------------------------------


-  **The Wandering Application**, included in the Autonomous Mobile Robot, demonstrates the
   combination of the middleware, algorithms, and the ROS 2 navigation stack. It showcases the
   ability to navigate a robot to explore an unknown environment, avoiding hitting obstacles, updating a local
   map in real-time exposed as a ROS topic, and publishing AI objects
   detected in another ROS topic (It uses the robot's sensors and actuators based on its hardware configuration.)

-  **Object Detection AI Application**, detects objects in video data using a deep
   learning neural network model from the OpenVINO™ `Model Zoo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo>`__

-  **Semantic Segmentation AI Application**, is a computer vision application that assigns labels to each pixel according to the object it belongs to,
   creating so-called segmentation masks.

-  **Ground Floor Segmentation Application**, uses pointcloud data for distinguishing between ground floor,
   elevated surfaces, obstacles, and structures above ground level.

-  **Benchmarking Application**, is a toolkit that uses the Autonomous Mobile Robot ingredients to run various combinations of Robotic application & AI application to estimate robotics and
   deep learning inference performances respectively on supported devices.
