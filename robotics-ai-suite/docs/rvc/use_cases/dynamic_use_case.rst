This exemplary use case shows how the robot actively tracks a group of objects
in real-time as they unpredictably navigate through three-dimensional space.
Subsequently, the robot picks up these objects and accurately places them at their
designated destination.


.. note::

    Every component has an option to change the default namespace:
    ``namespace:=<namspace>`` which by default is "ipc".

    If specified, the components will only see other components if they have same namespaces.

    Moreover, some components require additional configuration depending on this name, more specifically
    the existence of a config file ``d415camera<namespace>.xacro``. in ``<installdir>/rvc_dynamic_motion_controller_use_case/cameraurdf/`` directory


.. note::

    After following at least once :ref:`Preliminary system configuration<preliminary_system_configuration>` guide, i.e.: calibrating camera and robot,
    Then the quick start guide to start RVC is to execute in three different terminals:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ros2 launch rvc_dynamic_motion_controller_use_case rviz2_launch.py
        ros2 launch rvc_vision_main vision.composition.launch.py
        ros2 launch rvc_dynamic_motion_controller_use_case dynamic_demo_launch.py robot_ip:=<robot_ip>

    Then press play on the Universal Robots UR5e teach pendant
