# Vision Component Container

## Preliminary Steps

Before execution, there are some important steps to follow:

- Yolo model retrain
- Objects pcd creation
- rvc_use_case_binaries package creation

### Yolo Model Retrain

To retrain our yolo v5 model we followed [this tutorial](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/train_custom_data).

Then convert the model to openvino:

```bash
python3 path/to/export.py --weights <retrainedmodel>.pt --include openvino
```

If there are troubles with this, follow [issue 5533](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/5533).

### PCD Files Creation

To create our PCD files, for two different setups we went through two different approaches:

#### PCD File Creation from 3D Printable STL Files

> **Note:** We created our set of objects with a 3D modeler, 3D printed and then used the mesh files to create the pcd files. The [pose_detector](../../components/rvc_vision/dynamic_vision/pose_detector.md) requires these pcd files.

We used the tool obj2pcd offered in the libpcd tool `pcl_obj2pcd` installable with:

```bash
sudo apt install pcl-tools
```

Here the step by step procedure:

- Create the stl file to 3D print the object via [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) or similar.
- Import the stl file via [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

  ![Import STL Blender menu](../../images/html/importSTL.png)

- Edit so the metrics matches the RealSense Camera metrics: Units are in meters AND the center of the object is in the origin of blender and parallel to the axes where applicable. In short, perform scaling, rotating and translating operations so that dimension matches the realsense camera and the rototranslation from blender origin matches the desired outcome. For example, looking at the following image, the imported STL has been scaled down so the side of the cube is 5CM (0.05 meters), and translated down the Z axis of 0.025 centimeters, so the center of the cube is at 0,0,0. No rotation was needed as the cube was already parallel to the absolute reference system.

- Export the object in WaveFront format (.obj) as shown in picture.

  ![Blender menu to export selected object to WaveFront format](../../images/html/exportToObj.png)

- Convert the .obj file to pcd file with `pcl_obj2pcd`.

> **Note:** The RVC Pose Detector will align this object PCD file to the input cloud from realsense. This means calculating how much every point of the object pcd is translated and rotated on top of the realsense pointcloud from the original file location. To have a consistent meaning, the object baricenter should be in the origin to simulate the center of the optical camera (where all the optical and depth information are translated to). In this way, the algorithm will determine how far and how rotated the object is from the camera optical lens. If the object is not centered in 0,0,0, this calculation would be wrong. See following picture:

#### PCD File Creation from Blender Modeler

We used the Open Source 3D modeler [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

We create the object and then assured there was enough vertices by subdividing the mesh (ctrl R in edit mode), see: [Method 2](https://themotiontree.com/how-to-subdivide-in-blender/).

Then export the mesh in obj format and converting it with `pcl_obj2pcd` as exposed above.

Verify that the PCD file has enough points using the `pcl_viewer` tool which comes together with `pcl_obj2pcd`:

```bash
pcl_viewer <pcdFilename.pcd>
```

This is shown in the following image:

### rvc_use_case_binaries Package Creation

- Create a [ROS2 package](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html) named `rvc_use_case_binaries` and adapt the files to match your object `.pcd` files:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format3.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
<package format="3">
<name>rvc_use_case_binaries</name>
<version>2.0.0</version>
<description>Package containing sample PCD objects and AI models</description>
<maintainer email="robotics@intel.com">Intel Robotics Team</maintainer>

<test_depend>ament_lint_common</test_depend>

<export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
</export>
</package>
```

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(rvc_use_case_binaries)

find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)

install(FILES
  ai_models/yolo_nano.xml
  ai_models/yolo_nano.bin
  DESTINATION
  share/${PROJECT_NAME}/ai_models
  )

install(FILES
  pcd_objects/obj1.pcd
  pcd_objects/obj2.pcd
  [...]
  DESTINATION
  share/${PROJECT_NAME}/pcd_objects
  )

ament_package()
```

- Create `ai_models` and `pcd_objects` directories inside this package.
- Add yolo models in `ai_models` and pcd files in `pcd_objects`.

> **Note:** The models are converted in `<modelname>_openvino_model` in the yolov5 dir.

- Edit `parameters.yaml` of `object_detection` and `pose_detection` to match the names of these files.

## Container Execution

```bash
ros2 launch rvc_vision_main vision.composition.launch.py <namespace:=ipc>
```
