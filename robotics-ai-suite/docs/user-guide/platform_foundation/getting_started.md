# Getting Started

This guide will setup and install the Robotics AI Suite, providing a common base
for running the included ingredients and reference applications, and for developing
your own applications.

## Requirements
This guide expects you to be familiar with common Linux terminal commands. An understanding
of ROS is also highly recommended.

- Review the [System Requirements](system_requirements.md) before installation.

| **[Image Composer Tool Setup](getting_started/image_composer_tool.md)** | Build a pre-configured, bootable OS image (ISO or raw disk) with ROS 2 and the Robotics AI Suite repositories for deployment to multiple systems or fresh installations. | Recommended if you want to scale the deployment to many systems. |
| **[Step by Step](getting_started/step_by_step.md)** | Go through configuring and installing the necessary content on your system manually, one step at a time. | Recommended if you want to understand the individual setup steps. Not recommended for most deployments. |
