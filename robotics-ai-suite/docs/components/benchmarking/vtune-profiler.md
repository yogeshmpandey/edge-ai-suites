# VTune™ Profiler for CPU and GPU profiling

## Overview

VTune™ Profiler is a performance analysis tool for applications and
systems, which helps in analyzing and optimizing the application
performance, system performance and system configuration. The profiling
can be executed on a CPU, GPU or FPGA. It can profile both
single-threaded as well as multi-threaded applications. Refer the

## Additional System Setup for CPU and GPU Profiling

1. Build and Install the Sampling Drivers for Linux Targets.

   To do CPU and GPU profiling using driverless sampling collection on
   processors based on Intel® Performance Hybrid Architecture, which
   has been introduced from 12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, the
   VTune™ Profiler sampling drivers must be installed and loaded using
   root credentials. Follow the steps to
   [Build and Install the Sampling Drivers for Linux Targets](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2024-0/build-install-sampling-drivers-for-linux-targets.html).

2. System setup for CPU and GPU profiling.

   As described in
   [Set Up System for GPU Analysis](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2024-0/set-up-system-for-gpu-analysis.html),
   to analyze Intel® HD and Intel® Iris Graphics hardware events, the
   profiler requires that the "Intel Metric Discovery(MD) API"
   Library is installed and that the necessary permissions to enable
   the collecting of GPU hardware metrics.

   - Refer to
     [Set Up System for GPU Analysis](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2024-0/set-up-system-for-gpu-analysis.html),
     to build and install the Intel Metric Discovery(MD) API Library.

   - Run the below command to grant relevant permission to enable the
     collecting of GPU hardware metrics for non-privileged users.

     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0
     ```

   - Run the below command to remove the limited scope of the
     "ptrace()" system call.

     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0
     ```

   - Run the below command to disallow raw tracepoint access to
     unprivileged users.

     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=0
     ```

   - Run the below command to remove the restrictions are placed on
     exposing kernel addresses via /proc and other interfaces.

     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w kernel.kptr_restrict=0
     ```

   - Run the below command to add the user to the video and render
     group.

     ```bash
     sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
     sudo usermod -a -G render $USER
     ```

## Profiling an Application from Autonomous Mobile Robot

The example application from Autonomous Mobile Robot considered for the
CPU and GPU profiling is the "Collaborative visual slam with
fastmapping enabled" application from the
[Collaborative Visual SLAM](../../components/optimized_solutions/collaborative-slam.md)
tutorial. The two CPU analyses types considered in this
example are `CPU Hotspots` analysis and
`CPU Microarchitecture Exploration` analysis. Furthermore, the GPU
analysis type considered is `GPU Offload` analysis. The CPU and GPU
profiling are carried out using the `vtune` command line tool. However,
the `vtune-gui` tool is later used to visualize and understand the
findings.

### CPU Profiling

#### CPU Hotspots Analysis

The CPU Hotspots Analysis is carried out with the following parameters:

- Hardware sampling enabled with sampling interval of 5ms.
- Stack collection enabled with stack size of 2048B.
- The application is called directly by the profiler.
- The profiler runs and profiles the application for 30 seconds and
  terminates the application.

##### Steps to run CPU Hotspots Analysis

1. Install the "Collaborative visual slam with fastmapping enabled"
   application from the
   [Collaborative Visual SLAM](../../components/optimized_solutions/collaborative-slam.md)
   tutorial.

2. Run the below command to source the ROS 2 setup files.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive-->  **Humble**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: humblehide_directive-->

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

3. Run the below command to set the ROS_DOMAIN_ID.

   ```bash
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=67
   ```

4. Run the below command to source the VTune environment

   ```bash
   source /opt/intel/oneapi/vtune/latest/env/vars.sh
   ```

5. Run the below command on the terminal to start the CPU Hotspots
   Analysis of the "Collaborative visual slam with fastmapping
   enabled" application from the
   [Collaborative Visual SLAM](../../components/optimized_solutions/collaborative-slam.md)
   tutorial.

   <!--hide_directive::::{tab-set}hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive:::{tab-item}hide_directive--> **Jazzy**
   <!--hide_directive:sync: jazzyhide_directive-->

   ```bash
   vtune -collect hotspots -knob sampling-mode=hw -knob sampling-interval=5 -knob enable-stack-collection=true -knob stack-size=2048 -duration=30 -result-dir ./vtune_results_hotspots /opt/ros/jazzy/share/collab-slam/tutorial-fastmapping/cslam-fastmapping.sh

   ```

   <!--hide_directive:::hide_directive-->
   <!--hide_directive::::hide_directive-->

The results are collected in `vtune_results_hotspots` directory.

> **Note**:
