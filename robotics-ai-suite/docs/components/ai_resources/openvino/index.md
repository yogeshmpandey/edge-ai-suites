# OpenVINO

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/) is the primary toolkit for optimizing and
deploying deep-learning inference in Robotics AI Suite applications. It supports
models from common frameworks and can target available Intel compute devices.

Use the current [OpenVINO installation documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/get-started/install-openvino.html) for the selected environment.

## Reference Applications

OpenVINO reference applications cover object detection, segmentation, and
RealSense camera workflows.

## Additional Guidance

- [OpenVINO model guidance](models/index.md) includes reusable perception,
  manipulation, and foundation-model guidance. The workflows require the
    [platform getting-started guide](../../../platform_foundation/getting_started.md)
    when used with the Humanoid Toolkit.

## Benchmarking

Use the upstream [OpenVINO Benchmark Tool](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/get-started/learn-openvino/openvino-samples/benchmark-tool.html)
to estimate deep-learning inference throughput and latency on supported Intel®
devices. Install OpenVINO and its samples with the [OpenVINO sample guidance](https://docs.openvino.ai/2026/get-started/learn-openvino/openvino-samples/get-started-demos.html)
before benchmarking.

Use the same OpenVINO version to convert a model and to run inference unless the
model's documentation explicitly supports a different compatibility path.
