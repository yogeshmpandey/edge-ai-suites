# Intel® Extension for PyTorch

> **Support for Intel® Extension for PyTorch has been discontinued in favor of PyTorch XPU, which enables Intel GPU access for PyTorch operations. More information is available at [PyTorch XPU](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.13/notes/get_start_xpu.html)

Intel® Extension for PyTorch extends the PyTorch library with the latest performance optimizations for Intel's hardware. Optimizations take advantage of Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX) on Intel CPUs as well as Intel XeMatrix Extensions (XMX) AI engines on Intel discrete GPUs. Moreover, Intel® Extension for PyTorch provides easy GPU acceleration for Intel discrete GPUs through the PyTorch xpu device.

The extension can be loaded as a Python module for Python programs or linked as a C++ library for C++ programs. In Python scripts users can enable it dynamically by importing `intel_extension_for_pytorch`.
