Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT)
####################################

Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT) is the largest bimanual manipulation foundation model with strong generalizability. RDT employs the diffusion transformer as its scalable backbone, with special designs for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation. RDT proposes the Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, a unified action format for various robots with gripper arms, which enables the model to learn generalizable physical knowledge across diverse robotic datasets.

A RDT pipeline is provided for evaluating the VLA model on the simulation task. This pipeline includes source code optimized with OpenVINO™ for improved performance, and supports running inference on Intel GPUs (discrete GPU and integrated GPU).

In this tutorial, we will introduce how to setup RDT simulation pipeline.

Simulation Task
===============

We have enabled two tasks in the RDT pipeline using the MUJOCO simulation environment, which is also used in the :doc:`./imitation_learning_act` pipeline. A set of datasets has been collected in this environment for fine-tuning the RDT model. You can further modify the simulation tasks to collect additional data for fine-tuning the pre-trained RDT model.

Transfer Cube
::::::::::::::

Transfer the red cube to the other arm. The right arm touches (#1) and grasps (#2) the red cube, then hands it to the left arm.

Default language instruction: "Use the right robot arm to pick up the red cube and transfer it to the left robot arm."

Peg Insertion
::::::::::::::

Insert the red peg into the blue socket. Both arms grasp (#1), let socket and peg make contact (#2) and insertion.

Default language instruction: "Pick up a red peg and insert into the blue socket with a hole in it."

Prerequisites
=============

Please make sure you have finished setup steps in :doc:`../installation_setup`.

.. _rdt_installation:

Installation
=============

Install RDT package
::::::::::::::::::::

The Embodied Intelligence SDK provides optimized source code for Intel® OpenVINO™. To get the source code from ``/opt/rdt-ov/`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install rdt-ov
    sudo chown -R $USER /opt/rdt-ov/

After installing the ``rdt-ov`` package, follow the ``README.md`` file in ``/opt/rdt-ov/`` to set up the complete source code environment.

MUJOCO environment setup
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

The RDT pipeline uses the MUJOCO simulation environment, which is also used in the :doc:`./imitation_learning_act` pipeline. So you can copy the MUJOCO environment setup from the ACT pipeline.

.. attention::

    If you haven't set up the complete source code of the ``ACT`` package, please follow :ref:`Install ACT pipeline of OpenVINO <act-ov>` to set up the complete source code environment first.

Next, copy these assets to the RDT pipeline directory as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/eval_sim/assets/mujoco/
    cp -r <act_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/assets/* <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/eval_sim/assets/mujoco/

Prepare Environment
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can choose to use a Python virtual environment or a Docker container for the RDT pipeline. The following sections will guide you through both methods.

Use Python Virtual Environment
-------------------------------

Download and install the ``Miniforge`` as follows if you don't have conda installed on your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc

You can use ``conda --version`` to verify you conda installation.
After installation, create a new python environment ``rdt-ov``:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n rdt-ov python=3.11

After installation, activate the ``rdt-ov`` Python environment in your current terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate rdt-ov

Install the dependencies with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install torch==2.2.0 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    pip install packaging==24.0
    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install huggingface_hub==0.23.4 opencv-python==4.10.0.84 numpy==1.26.4 mujoco==3.2.6 dm_control==1.0.26 einops ipython

Install the OpenVINO™ with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install openvino==2025.2

Use Docker Container
----------------------

If you prefer to use a Docker container, you can build the container from the provided `Dockerfile` in the project. The Dockerfile is already set up with all the necessary dependencies.

Build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/docker
    docker build -t embodied-intelligence-sdk/rdt-1b-ov:latest --build-arg http_proxy=${http_proxy}  --build-arg https_proxy=${https_proxy} .


.. note::

    If you encounter any issues during the Docker pulling, please check your network settings and ensure that the proxy is correctly configured. You can refer to :ref:`Troubleshooting <docker_proxy_troubleshooting>` for more information.

Run the docker container:

.. note::

    Please replace ``<rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>`` with the actual path where you have the RDT source code.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it \
        --network host \
        --device /dev/dri \
        -v <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>:<rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH> \
        -v ${HOME}/.cache/:/home/.cache \
        -e USERNAME=${USER} \
        -e RENDER_GID=$(getent group render | cut -d: -f3) \
        -e http_proxy=${http_proxy} \
        -e https_proxy=${https_proxy} \
        --name rdt_test  --rm  embodied-intelligence-sdk/rdt-1b-ov:latest bash

.. note::

    Here is a brief explanation of the command options:

    - ``--network host`` is to use host network.
    - ``--device /dev/dri`` is to use host GPU device.
    - ``-v ${HOME}/.cache/:/home/.cache`` is to reuse huggingface model download cache.
    - ``-e USERNAME=${USER}`` A user with the same name as the current user will be created, avoiding potential privilege issues with root user.
    - ``-e RENDER_GID=$(getent group render | cut -d: -f3)`` is to get host `render` group id to gain access to GPU device.

Run pipeline
=============

Inference
:::::::::

1. Download the pre-trained ``google/t5-v1_1-xxl`` model from the Hugging Face Hub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
      mkdir google & cd google
      sudo apt install git-lfs
      GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://hf-mirror.com/google/t5-v1_1-xxl
      cd t5-v1_1-xxl
      git lfs pull

2. Use the following command to generate the language instruction embedding file. This file will be loaded by the pipeline during inference.

.. attention::

    Since the ``google/t5-v1_1-xxl`` model is large, it may take a while to download the model weights. Please ensure you have enough disk space (200G) available and enough RAM (64G) to run the Python script.

* Transfer Cube task:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
    python -m eval_sim.language_to_pt --instruction_name "TransferCube-v1" --instruction "Use the right robot arm to pick up the red cube and transfer it to the left robot arm." --device cpu

* Peg Insertion task:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
    python -m eval_sim.language_to_pt --instruction_name "PegInsertion-v1" --instruction "Pick up a red peg and insert into the blue socket with a hole in it." --device cpu

After running the above command, you will get two files named ``text_embed_TransferCube-v1.pt`` and ``text_embed_PegInsertion-v1.pt`` in the ``<rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>`` directory.

3. You can download our fine-tuned weights from this link: `Download Link <https://eci.intel.com/embodied-sdk-docs/_downloads/RDT-sim-ft-weights.zip>`_, and then follow the instructions in ``<rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>/scripts/convert/README.md`` to convert the model to the OpenVINO™ format.

.. note::

    | For detailed instructions on the model conversion process, please refer to the model tutorial at :doc:`../developer_tools_tutorials/model_tutorials/model_rdt`.
    | Of course, you can download `the pre-trained RDT-1B weights <https://hf-mirror.com/robotics-diffusion-transformer/rdt-1b>`_ from the Hugging Face Hub, but it is recommended to fine-tune the weights with ALOHA dataset for better performance to achieve the best results in the ALOHA MUJOCO simulation tasks.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
    python -m scripts.convert.ov_convert --pretrained <fine-tuned_weights_path> --output_dir ov_ir

After running the above command, you will get a ``ov_ir`` directory in the ``<rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>`` directory.

4. You can now run the inference pipeline using the converted OpenVINO™ model.

.. note::

    Here is a brief explanation of the command options:

    * ``MUJOCO_GL=egl`` environment variable can be set to enable EGL rendering, which provides better performance in simulation scenarios.
    * ``--env-id`` specifies the environment ID, which can be either ``TransferCube-v1`` or ``PegInsertion-v1``.
    * ``--device`` specifies the device to run the inference on, which can be either ``GPU`` or ``CPU``.
    * ``--num-traj`` specifies the number of trajectories to run in the simulation environment.
    * ``--onscreen_render`` can be used to enable onscreen rendering.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <rdt_SOURCE_CODE_PATH>
    MUJOCO_GL=egl python -m eval_sim.eval_rdt_aloha_static_ov --env-id "TransferCube-v1" --openvino_ir_path "ov_ir" --device GPU --num-traj 50
