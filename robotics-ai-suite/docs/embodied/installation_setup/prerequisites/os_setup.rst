To leverage all Embodied Intelligence SDK features, the target system should meet the :ref:`recommended system requirements <Target_System>`.

This section explains the procedure to install a compatible OS on the target system.

Do the following to prepare the target system:

#. Follow with `Ubuntu Installation Guide <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop>`_ to install Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop with  **64bits** variant on to the target system.
