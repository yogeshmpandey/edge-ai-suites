# General-purpose robot foundation model (Pi0)

Pi0 created by Physical Intelligence introduces a groundbreaking robotic model designed to integrate vision, language, and action (VLA) for general-purpose robotic tasks.

**Model Architecture:**

- A larger VLM backbone with weights initialized from PaliGemma that is pre-trained from large-scale Internet pre-training.
- A smaller action expert (Diffusion Transformer) addresses robot states and generates actions.
