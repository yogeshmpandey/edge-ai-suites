#############################

The `OpenXLA <https://github.com/openxla/xla>`_ Project brings together a community of developers and leading AI/ML teams to accelerate ML and address infrastructure fragmentation across ML frameworks and hardware.

IntelÂ® Extension for OpenXLA includes PJRT plugin implementation, which seamlessly runs JAX models on Intel GPU. The PJRT API simplified the integration, which allowed the Intel GPU plugin to be developed separately and quickly integrated into JAX. This same PJRT implementation also enables initial Intel GPU support for TensorFlow and PyTorch models with XLA acceleration.
