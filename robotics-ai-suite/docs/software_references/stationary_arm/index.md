# Stationary Arm Reference Software

The Stationary Arm reference software series provide reference workflows for fixed robotic arms operating in structured environments. Built on ROS 2 and MoveIt 2 Servo, these demos showcase vision-guided pick-and-place workflows in both simulation and physical hardware deployment.
