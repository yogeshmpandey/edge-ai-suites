# Sample Pipelines

Sample pipelines are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the Humanoid Toolkit. Review the [validated hardware configuration](../../hardware_blueprints/humanoid/index.md#validated-configuration) before running a pipeline.

These pipelines are designed to showcase core Humanoid Toolkit features, including imitation learning, vision-based manipulation and SLAM. Each pipeline includes a detailed description, along with instructions for running the sample code on your system.
