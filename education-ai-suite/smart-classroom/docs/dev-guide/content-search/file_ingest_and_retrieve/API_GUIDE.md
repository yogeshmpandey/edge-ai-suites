  "visual_db_inited": true,
  "document_db_inited": true,
  "storage_available": true
}
```

---

## Ingest Files

Files must first be uploaded to storage before they can be ingested. The service downloads the file, extracts embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.

**Supported file types:** `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.mp4`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pptx`, `.ppt`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.xml`, `.md`

### POST /v1/dataprep/ingest

Ingest a single file or a directory from storage.

#### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `bucket_name` | string | Yes | — | storage bucket name |
| `file_path` | string | Yes | — | Path to the file inside the bucket |
| `meta` | object | No | `{}` | Extra metadata to store alongside the file |


#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "file_path": "videos/lecture.mp4",
    "meta": { "course": "CS101", "semester": "Spring 2026" }
  }'
```

With list-valued metadata fields:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "file_path": "documents/report.pdf",
    "meta": {
      "tags": ["finance", "quarterly", "2026"],
      "authors": ["Alice", "Bob"],
      "year": 2026
    }
  }'
```

> **Note:** Metadata values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or **homogeneous lists** (all elements must be the same type). The `tags` field, if provided, must be a **list of strings** — passing a non-list or a list with non-string elements returns `422`.

#### Response

```json
{ "message": "File successfully processed. db returns ..." }
```

---

Ingest a directory from storage. All supported files found under a given folder prefix will be processed.

#### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `bucket_name` | string | Yes | — | storage bucket name |
| `folder_path` | string | Yes | — | Folder prefix inside the bucket |
| `meta` | object | No | `{}` | Extra metadata applied to every file ingested from the directory |

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "folder_path": "course-materials/week1/"
  }'
```

With list-valued metadata applied to every file in the directory:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "folder_path": "course-materials/week1/",
    "meta": {
      "course": "CS101",
      "topics": ["arrays", "linked lists", "sorting"],
      "week": 1
    }
  }'
```

#### Response

```json
{ "message": "Files from storage directory successfully processed. db returns ..." }
```

> **Tip:** The service distinguishes between a single-file request and a directory request based on the presence of `file_path` vs `folder_path`.

---

## Ingest raw text

### POST /v1/dataprep/ingest_text

Embeds a raw text string as a **single node** (no chunking) and stores it in the document collection. Use this when you already have clean, pre-processed text and want to skip file parsing entirely.

#### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `text` | string | Yes | — | Raw text content to embed and store |
| `bucket_name` | string | No | — | storage bucket name (used to build the `file_path` identifier) |
| `file_path` | string | No | — | Logical path inside the bucket (used to build the `file_path` identifier) |
| `meta` | object | No | `{}` | Extra metadata to store alongside the text |

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest_text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "file_path": "summaries/lecture1.txt",
    "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light into energy.",
    "meta": { "course": "CS101", "source": "summary" }
  }'
```

With tags metadata:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/ingest_text \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bucket_name": "content-search",
    "file_path": "summaries/lecture1.txt",
    "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light into energy.",
    "meta": {
      "tags": ["biology", "plants", "energy"],
      "related_chapters": [3, 4],
      "course": "BIO101"
    }
  }'
```

> **Note:** The `tags` field must be a **list of strings** — passing a non-list or a list with non-string elements returns `422`.

Below metadatas shall be automatically appended
```json
"meta": {
  "chunk_index": 0,
  "chunk_text": "text",
  "type": "document",
  "doc_filetype": "text/plain",
}
```

#### Response

```json
{ "message": "Text successfully ingested. db returns ..." }
```

**Error responses**

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `400` | `text` is empty or missing |
| `422` | `tags` in `meta` is not a list of strings |
| `500` | Embedding or database error |

---

## Query Indexed Files

### GET /v1/dataprep/get

Look up all indexed entries for a specific file.

**Query parameter**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file_path` | string | Yes | The storage URI of the file, e.g. `local://bucket/path/file.pdf` |

#### Example

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/get?file_path=local://my-bucket/documents/report.pdf"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "file_path": "local://my-bucket/documents/report.pdf",
  "ids_in_db": ["id-1", "id-2", "id-3"]
}
```

**Error responses**

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `400` | `file_path` is missing or not a string |
| `404` | Path scheme is not `local://` or `http(s)://` |
| `200` | File embedding not found in the database (not yet ingested, or id_map out of sync — call `POST /v1/dataprep/recover` to resync) |

---

## Delete Files from Index

### DELETE /v1/dataprep/delete

Remove all indexed entries for a specific file. **The original file in storage is not deleted.**

**Query parameter**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file_path` | string | Yes | The storage URI of the file to remove from the index |

#### Example

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/delete?file_path=local://my-bucket/documents/report.pdf"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "File successfully deleted. db returns: ...",
  "removed_ids": ["id-1", "id-2", "id-3"]
}
```

**Error responses**

| Code | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `400` | `file_path` is missing or not a string |
| `404` | Path scheme is not `local://` or `http(s)://` |
| `200` | File embedding not found in the database (not yet ingested, or id_map out of sync — call `POST /v1/dataprep/recover` to resync) |

---

## Clear the Entire Index

### DELETE /v1/dataprep/delete_all

Remove **all** entries from the database. **Original files in storage are not deleted.**

#### Example

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/delete_all
```

#### Response

```json
{ "message": "Database successfully cleared. db returns: ..." }
```

---

## File and Embedding ID Maps

### GET /v1/dataprep/list

Returns the current in-memory id_maps without modifying anything. Use this to inspect which file paths and DB IDs are currently tracked.

**Request**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/list
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "visual": {
    "local://my-bucket/images/photo.jpg": ["2001"]
  },
  "document": {
    "local://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf": ["1001", "1002", "1003"]
  }
}
```

---

### POST /v1/dataprep/recover

Clears and rebuilds the in-memory id_maps by re-querying both ChromaDB collections. Use this when `GET /v1/dataprep/get` or `DELETE /v1/dataprep/delete` returns an unexpected "not found" message for a file that was previously ingested — which can happen after a server restart, a crash mid-ingest, or any direct modification of the database outside this service.

**Request**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/recover
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "ID maps successfully recovered from database.",
  "recovered": {
    "visual_files": 12,
    "document_files": 5
  }
}
```

- `visual_files` — number of distinct file paths recovered into the visual id_map
- `document_files` — number of distinct file paths recovered into the document id_map

> **Note:** POST is write-only with respect to in-memory state — it rebuilds the id_maps from the database but does not modify any stored data.

---

## Retrieval

### POST /v1/retrieval

Search the index using a text query or a base64-encoded image. Returns the top-k most similar results from both the visual and document collections.

#### Request body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | string | One of `query` or `image_base64` | Natural language search query |
| `image_base64` | string | One of `query` or `image_base64` | Base64-encoded image to search by visual similarity |
| `filter` | object | No | Metadata filter to narrow results (see [Filter usage](#filter-usage) below). |
| `max_num_results` | integer | No (default `10`) | Max results per collection (1–16384). For text queries, up to `2 × max_num_results` may be returned (top-k from visual collection + top-k from document collection, merged and sorted by distance). For image queries, at most `max_num_results` are returned. |

> **Note:** Provide exactly one of `query` or `image_base64` — not both.

**Text search example**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "photosynthesis diagram",
    "max_num_results": 5
  }'
```

**Image search example**

```bash
# Encode an image to base64 first
IMAGE_B64=$(base64 -w 0 my_image.jpg)

curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"image_base64\": \"$IMAGE_B64\",
    \"max_num_results\": 5
  }"
```

---

#### Filter usage

Different filter keys are always combined with **AND**. When a filter value is a **list**, the matching logic depends on the field type:

| Field type | Example fields | List behavior | Operator used |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Array metadata** | `tags` | Matches if the stored array contains **at least one** of the filter values | `$contains` |
| **Scalar metadata** | `type`, `course`, `semester` | Matches if the stored value **equals any** of the filter values | `$eq` (OR) |

> **For Developer:** A placeholder for list fields parsed as `"and"` (all values must match) is available via the `list_filter_mode` parameter internally.

**Filter by tags** — returns results whose `tags` array contains `"biology"` or `"plants"`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "lecture notes",
    "filter": { "tags": ["biology", "plants"] },
    "max_num_results": 5
  }'
```

**Filter by type** — available values: `"video"`, `"image"`, `"document"`. If not specified, all types are returned. Example returns only `video` or `document` results:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Newton first law",
    "filter": { "type": ["video", "document"] },
    "max_num_results": 5
  }'
```

> **Note:** Video-type results may appear even when `"video"` is not explicitly selected in the `type` filter, because relevant document summaries can be converted into video results during post-processing. These constructed results have `"original_type": "constructed_from_summary"` in their metadata to distinguish them from native video frame results.

**Filter for constructed summaries** — returns only video results that were constructed from document summaries:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Newton first law",
    "filter": { "original_type": "constructed_from_summary" },
    "max_num_results": 10
  }'
```

**Combined filter** — keys are ANDed together:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "lecture notes",
    "filter": { "course": "CS101", "tags": ["biology", "plants"] },
    "max_num_results": 3
  }'
```

Returns results where `course` equals `"CS101"` **AND** `tags` contains `"biology"` or `"plants"`.

---

#### Response

Results are sorted by `score` descending (highest relevance first). Each result includes:

- `id` — unique identifier of the indexed chunk/frame
- `distance` — cosine distance (lower = more similar)
- `meta` — metadata (see fields below)
- `score` — relevance score (0–100, higher = better)
- `reranker_score` — (documents only) raw cross-encoder score

The `filter` object accepts any metadata key present in the result's `meta` field (e.g. `type`, `tags`, `course`, `doc_filetype`, `original_type`). See [Filter usage](#filter-usage) for details on how scalar and array fields are matched.

## Developer-Only APIs

> **Note:** The following endpoints are for testing and debugging purposes only. They are not part of the production API.

### DELETE /v1/dataprep/delete_by_ids

Delete specific entries by their IDs. Handles orphaned IDs (not tracked in id_maps) by attempting a fallback direct delete from both collections.

#### Request body

```json
{
  "ids": ["503415479151881641", "1234567890"]
}
```

- `ids` — list of string IDs to delete (IDs are stored as strings in ChromaDB)

#### Example

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9990/v1/dataprep/delete_by_ids \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ids": ["id-1", "id-2"]}'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully deleted 2 entries. db returns: ...",
  "removed_ids": ["id-1", "id-2"]
}
```

> For orphaned ids, db returns empty

#### Error responses

| Code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | `ids` is empty or not a list |
| `200` | No matching IDs found (still returns 200 with empty `removed_ids`) |
| `500` | Database error |

---

### POST /v1/retrieval/image

Perform image-based retrieval by uploading an image file directly (multipart form data). Avoids the manual base64 encoding step required by `/v1/retrieval`.

#### Form parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | file | Yes | Image file (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) |
| `filter` | string | No | Metadata filter as JSON string (e.g., `{"course": "CS101"}`) |
| `max_num_results` | integer | No (default `10`) | Max results (1–16384) |

#### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval/image \
  -F "image=@photo.jpg" \
  -F "max_num_results=5"
```

With filters:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9990/v1/retrieval/image \
  -F "image=@photo.jpg" \
  -F "filter={\"course\": \"CS101\", \"tags\": [\"biology\"]}" \
  -F "max_num_results=3"
```

#### Response

Same format as `/v1/retrieval`:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "distance": 0.142,
      "score": 85.75,
      "meta": { "file_path": "local://...", "type": "image" }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Error responses

| Code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | `image` file is missing, invalid JSON in `filter`, or `max_num_results` out of range |
| `500` | Image processing or retrieval error |
