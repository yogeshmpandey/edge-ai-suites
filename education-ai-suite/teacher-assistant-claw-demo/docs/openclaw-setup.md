# OpenClaw setup for Teacher Assistant demo

The OpenClaw based agent functions as the "Teacher Assistant" persona that enables the staff of a school, which includes teachers, to create their own custom report based on the per classroom data provided by the Smart Classroom application. The custom report can be at a class level or at a grade level combining all classrooms in that grade and at the school level which combines all the grades. The deployment setup envisaged is shown in the figure below.

Note: In the figure, Smart Classroom is abbreviated as SC.

## Pre-requisites

### System Requirements for OpenClaw agent
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Intel PTL based system
- At least 32GB RAM
- 100GB free disk space for models and environments

### Smart Classroom setup
It is assumed here that Smart Classroom application is setup in a separate node compared to OpenClaw Agent. The WSL route of installing OpenClaw in a Windows environment and hence sharing the same compute resources with Smart Classroom app is not covered in this version. The set-up of the Smart Classroom is as per the documentation provided in the Smart Classroom application repo. This documentation is not repeated here. Communication between the Smart Classroom app and OpenClaw is covered in this documentation.

### Prepare for setup
- Docker engine installed and running
- Install curl, homebrew, and git as follows:
  ``` bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git procps
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

## Setup OVMS
OVMS should be setup before OpenClaw installation to ensure easy discoverability and configuration. The OVMS setup is done with the following simple steps.

``` bash
mkdir -p ~/models
docker run -d --rm \
       --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
       --device /dev/dri \
       --group-add=$(stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -n 1) \
       -p 8000:8000 \
       -v ~/models:/models \
       openvino/model_server:latest-gpu \
       --source_model OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov \
       --model_repository_path /models \
       --task text_generation \
       --tool_parser hermes3 \
       --rest_port 8000 \
       --target_device GPU \
       --cache_size 4
```
Verify OVMS is running using the following command
``` bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v3/models
```

## Setup OpenClaw

Perform the following steps to setup OpenClaw agent for the Teacher Assistant demo.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the repository and navigate to the Teacher Assistant demo directory. All subsequent commands assume you are in this directory.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
cd edge-ai-suites/education-ai-suite/teacher-assistant-claw-demo
```

### Step 2: OpenClaw installation

Quickly install OpenClaw using the following command. The version of OpenClaw can be changed as per the requirement.

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 2026.6.6 --no-onboard
```

### Step 3: Configure OpenClaw

Apply configuration from the repo and restart the gateway for the changes to take effect:

``` bash
openclaw config patch --file ./openclaw-config.json
openclaw gateway install
```

<details>

<summary>Useful debugging commands to check the status of OpenClaw and the gateway are provided below:</summary>

``` bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw status
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

</details>

<details> <summary>Alternativelly configure OpenClaw interactively.</summary>

The step 2 leads to OpenClaw onboarding process. Follow the steps listed below.
1. Read the security warning and press the left arrow key to navigate to Yes and hit Enter to continue. Hit enter again to select Quick Start.
2. Press the down arrow key to scroll down to "more" and hit Enter to expand the list, then continue scrolling down to "Custom Provider" and hit Enter.
3. Provide the OVMS link for API base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v3`
4. Press enter on API key.
5. Select `OpenAI` for end point compatibility. (TODO: Provide exact field name)
6. Enter the following for Model ID: `OpenVINO/Qwen3-8B-int4-ov`. This should give `verification successful` message on the screen. If not, go back to #3.
7. For Model Alias, enter a name of your choice. Example, `Qwen3-ovms`
8. Select the communication channel for your bot. Select `Telegram` for this use case.
9. Enter your Telegram bot token. On the screen, you should see instructions like:
   ``` bash
   Telegram bot token
    1) Open Telegram and chat with @BotFather
    2) Run /newbot (or /mybots)
    3) Copy the token (looks like 123456:ABC...)
   ```
   Todo: Link to the telegram documentation which should provide details on generating token, setting up bot etc.
10. Configure the web search API provider. TODO: Update. For now, select Duckduck Go.
11. Add the required skills. Select blogwatcher, nanopdf, clawhub (select npm), and github.
12. Skip the hooks configuration. TODO: revisit.
13. Hatch your claw in the terminal

### Step 4: Deploy workspace files

Copy the workspace configuration files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, SKILL.md) to the OpenClaw workspace directory. These files define the agent persona, available agents, and skills.

``` bash
chmod +x ./setup-openclaw-workspace.sh
./setup-openclaw-workspace.sh
```

This script creates the following structure:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── SOUL.md                          # Agent persona and behavior
├── AGENTS.md                        # Agent definitions
├── smart_classroom_incoming/        # Data directory for Smart Classroom reports
│   └── lesson1.md                   # Sample lesson report (included as example)
└── skills/
    └── smart-classroom/
        └── SKILL.md                 # Smart Classroom skill definition
```

> **Note:** The `smart_classroom_incoming/` directory is where the Smart Classroom application deposits lesson reports for the agent to analyze. A sample file (`lesson1.md`) is included as an example. You can add additional lesson reports to `~/.openclaw/workspace/smart_classroom_incoming/` at any time — the agent will pick them up automatically when answering questions or generating reports.

### Step 5: Run OpenClaw agent

Run the following commands to start the OpenClaw agent in the terminal or in the web dashboard.

``` bash
# Run the agent in the terminal
openclaw chat

# Run the agent in the web dashboard
openclaw dashboard
```
